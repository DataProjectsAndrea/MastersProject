""" I interrupted this cheerful conversation to remark that I had no intention of letting myself be massacred, and shortly afterwards Ingles parted from us. For some time we went along in silence, which Poirot at length broke by uttering a totally unexpected remark. ""I think I really think that I shall have to bring my brother into this."" ""Your brother,"" I cried, astonished. ""I never knew you had a brother?"" ""You surprise me, Hastings.",0
"In fact, I don’t know what I should do if I hadn’t got something to fall back upon.” “Don’t say you collect bugs!” “No. I share rooms with a very interesting man. He’s a Belgian an ex-detective. He’s set up as a private detective in London, and he’s doing extraordinarily well. He’s really a very marvellous little man. Time and again he has proved to be right where the official police have failed.” My companion listened with widening eyes. “Isn’t that interesting, now? I just adore crime. I go to all the mysteries on the movies. And when there’s a murder on I just devour the papers.” “Do you remember the Styles Case?” I asked.",0
"“You will understand me when I say that it was a deadly life for a girl brought up as I had been. The narrowness, the deadly monotony of it, almost drove me mad.” She paused a minute, and added in a different tone: “And then I met John Cavendish.” “Yes?” “You can imagine that, from my aunts’ point of view, it was a very good match for me. But I can honestly say it was not this fact which weighed with me. No, he was simply a way of escape from the insufferable monotony of my life.” I said nothing, and after a moment, she went on: “Don’t misunderstand me. I was quite honest with him.",0
"If anything had happened to Tommy he regretted it deeply, but he could do nothing. This was cold comfort. Somehow, without Tommy, all the savour went out of the adventure, and, for the first time, Tuppence felt doubtful of success. While they had been together she had never questioned it for a minute. Although she was accustomed to take the lead, and to pride herself on her quick-wittedness, in reality she had relied upon Tommy more than she realized at the time.",0
"“It is a quiet little place but chic! It lies about midway between Bolougne and Calais. It is rapidly becoming the fashion. Rich English people who wish to be quiet are taking it up. M. Renauld has a house in England, I suppose?” “Yes, in Rutland Gate, as far as I remember. Also a big place in the country, somewhere in Hertfordshire. But I really know very little about him, he doesn’t do much in a social way. I believe he has large South American interests in the City, and has spent most of his life out in Chile and the Argentino.” “Well, we shall hear all details from the man himself. Come, let us pack.",0
"Primed with the story that Madame Daubreuil has suggested to him, she permits herself to be gagged and bound. There, Poirot, what do you think of that?” I leaned back, flushed with the pride of successful reconstruction. Poirot looked at me thoughtfully. “I think that you should write for the Kinema, mon ami,” he remarked at last. “You mean ?” “It would make a good film, the story that you have recounted to me there but it bears no sort of resemblance to everyday life.” “I admit that I haven’t gone into all the details, but ” “You have gone further you have ignored them magnificently.",0
"They could hardly have been hidden on board and anyway we know they weren’t because they were offered for sale within half an hour of the Olympia’s arrival, long before I got the cables going and the numbers sent out. One broker swears he bought some of them even before the Olympia got in. But you can’t send bonds by wireless.” “Not by wireless, but did any tug come alongside?” “Only the official ones, and that was after the alarm was given when every one was on the look-out. I was watching out myself for their being passed over to some one that way. My God, Monsieur Poirot, this thing will drive me mad! People are beginning to say I stole them myself.",0
"The motor met me just outside the lodge gates, and I hurried there as fast as I could.” “Will you relate to us exactly what happened next?” “I entered Mrs. Inglethorp’s room. She was at that moment in a typical tetanic convulsion. She turned towards me, and gasped out: ‘Alfred Alfred ’” “Could the strychnine have been administered in Mrs. Inglethorp’s after-dinner coffee which was taken to her by her husband?” “Possibly, but strychnine is a fairly rapid drug in its action. The symptoms appear from one to two hours after it has been swallowed.",0
"""You never told me,” I said reproachfully. Poirot spread out his hands apologetically. “Pardon me, mon ami, you were not precisely sympathique.” He turned to me earnestly. “Tell me you see now that he must not be arrested?” “Perhaps,” I said doubtfully, for I was really quite indifferent to the fate of Alfred Inglethorp, and thought that a good fright would do him no harm. Poirot, who was watching me intently, gave a sigh. “Come, my friend,” he said, changing the subject, “apart from Mr. Inglethorp, how did the evidence at the inquest strike you?” “Oh, pretty much what I expected.",0
"Well, you see me! If you interest me, you will continue to see me for exactly two minutes longer.” “That will be ample,” I replied. “And I shall interest you. It’s the Mill House Mystery.” “If you’ve found ‘The Man in the Brown Suit,’ write to the Editor,” he interrupted hastily. “If you will interrupt, I shall be more than two minutes,” I said sternly. “I haven’t found ‘The Man in the Brown Suit,’ but I’m quite likely to do so.” In as few words as possible I put the facts of the Tube accident and the conclusions I had drawn from them before him.",0
"“I have made all arrangements. Is Mrs. Blair taking a maid with her?” “Mrs. Blair?” I gasped. “She tells me you offered her a place.” So I did, now I come to think of it. On the night of the Fancy Dress ball. I even urged her to come. But I never thought she would! Delightful as she is, I do not know that I want Mrs. Blair’s society all the way to Rhodesia and back. Women require such a lot of attention. And they are confoundedly in the way sometimes. “Have I asked any one else?” I said nervously. One does these things in moments of expansion. “Mrs. Blair seemed to think you had asked Colonel Race as well.” I groaned.",0
"“All goes well? But do not tell me that you have discovered the body of Mr. Davenheim in your lake, because I shall not believe you.” “We haven’t found the body, but we did find his clothes the identical clothes he was wearing that day. What do you say to that?” “Any other clothes missing from the house?” “No, his valet is quite positive on that point. The rest of his wardrobe is intact. There’s more. We’ve arrested Lowen. One of the maids, whose business it is to fasten the bedroom windows, declares that she saw Lowen coming towards the study through the rose-garden about a quarter past six. That would be about ten minutes before he left the house.",0
"Paynter an injection of strychnine, he says, but really of yellow jasmine a poisonous dose. When the drug begins to take effect, he departs, after unlatching the window. Then, in the night, he returns by the window, finds the manuscript, and shoves Mr. Paynter into the fire. He does not heed the newspaper that drops to the floor and is covered by the old man's body. Paynter knew what drug he had been given, and strove to accuse the Big Four of his murder. It is easy for Quentin to mix powdered opium with the curry before handing it over to be analysed.",0
"About ten minutes elapsed, and then the door opened, and a slender figure in widow’s weeds stood upon the threshold. “Monsieur Poirot?” she faltered. “Madame!” Poirot sprang gallantly to his feet and hastened towards her. “I cannot tell you how I regret to derange you in this way. But what will you? Les affaires they know no mercy.” Mrs. Maltravers permitted him to lead her to a chair. Her eyes were red with weeping, but the temporary disfigurement could not conceal her extraordinary beauty. She was about twenty-seven or eight, and very fair, with large blue eyes and a pretty pouting mouth.",0
"You deceived me all right. I hadn’t a suspicion of you! So I’ve no doubt that you understand perfectly well that this is where I’m on top and you’re underneath. Now then sit on the bed. Put your hands above your head, and if you value your life don’t move them.” Tuppence obeyed passively. Her good sense told her that there was nothing else to do but accept the situation. If she shrieked for help there was very little chance of anyone hearing her, whereas there was probably quite a good chance of Mrs. Vandemeyer’s shooting her.",0
"He looked at me. “You’ve made a mistake, I think,” he said, smiling. “Oh, no,” I said. “I’m sure I haven’t.” “You’ve given me the wrong roll. This is an unexposed one.” I walked out with what dignity I could muster. I dare say it is good for one now and again to realize what an idiot one can be! But nobody relishes the process. And then, just as I was passing one of the big shipping offices, I came to a sudden halt. In the window was a beautiful model of one of the company’s boats, and it was labelled “Kenilworth Castle.” A wild idea shot through my brain. I pushed the door open and went in.",0
"""Are you certain that there is nothing which might link the four together?” “I don’t quite understand you?” “I will put it plainly. Was any act committed by those four men which might seem to denote disrespect to the spirit of Men-her-Ra?” The doctor gazed at Poirot in astonishment. “You’re talking through your hat, Monsieur Poirot. Surely you’ve not been guyed into believing all that fool talk?” “Absolute nonsense,” muttered Willard angrily. Poirot remained placidly immovable, blinking a little out of his green cat’s eyes. “So you do not believe it, monsieur le docteur?” “No, sir, I do not,” declared the doctor emphatically. “I am a scientific man, and I believe only what science teaches.",0
"Tommy was amply employed, and debarred from joining him in the chase, the girl felt at a loose end. She retraced her steps to the entrance hall of the mansions. It was now tenanted by a small lift-boy, who was polishing brass fittings, and whistling the latest air with a good deal of vigour and a reasonable amount of accuracy. He glanced round at Tuppence’s entry. There was a certain amount of the gamin element in the girl, at all events she invariably got on well with small boys. A sympathetic bond seemed instantly to be formed.",0
"There, under an assumed name he marries, and finally acquires a vast fortune in South America. But there is a nostalgia upon him for his own country. Twenty years have elapsed, he is considerably changed in appearance, besides being a man of such eminence that no one is likely to connect him with a fugitive from justice many years ago. He deems it quite safe to return. He takes up his headquarters in England, but intends to spend the summers in France. And ill fortune, that obscure justice which shapes men’s ends, and will not allow them to evade the consequences of their acts, takes him to Merlinville.",0
"Is it true what they say, that he does not deny the crime? But that is madness. It is impossible that he should have done it! Never for one minute will I believe it.” “Neither do I believe it, mademoiselle,” said Poirot gently. “But then why does he not speak? I do not understand.” “Perhaps because he is screening some one,” suggested Poirot, watching her. Marthe frowned. “Screening some one? Do you mean his mother? Ah, from the beginning I have suspected her. Who inherits all that vast fortune? She does. It is easy to wear widow’s weeds and play the hypocrite. And they say that when he was arrested she fell down like that.",0
"To my surprise and annoyance he replied that there had been no camera. All Carton’s effects had been gone over very carefully in the hopes of finding something that might throw light upon his state of mind. He was positive that there had been no photographic apparatus of any kind. That was rather a set-back to my theory. If he had no camera, why should he be carrying a roll of films? I set out early next morning to take my precious roll to be developed. I was so fussy that I went all the way to Regent Street to the big Kodak place. I handed it in and asked for a print of each film. The man finished stacking together a heap of films packed in yellow tin cylinders for the tropics, and picked up my roll.",0
"de Castina, or whatever her real name was, had had an assignation to meet at the Mill House. That was how I pieced the thing together. Either because they feared they were being watched or for some other reason, they chose the rather ingenious method of both getting an order to view the same house. Thus their meeting there might have the appearance of pure chance. That the Moth Ball man had suddenly caught sight of the “doctor,” and that the meeting was totally unexpected and alarming to him, was another fact of which I was fairly sure. What had happened next? The “doctor” had removed his disguise and followed the woman to Marlow.",0
"The tears streaming down her face, she spoke of her child, of her woman’s honour of her desire to keep her reputation untarnished for the child’s sake. She admitted that, Georges Conneau having been her lover, she might perhaps be held morally responsible for the crime but, before God, nothing more! She knew that she had committed a grave fault in not denouncing Conneau to the law, but she declared in a broken voice that that was a thing no woman could have done.",0
"By the time the second lift reached the street level, there was no sign of my quarry. I hoped it was nothing important that he had lost, and for the first time I examined it. It was a plain half-sheet of notepaper with some figures and words scrawled upon it in pencil. This is a facsimile of it: [Indistinct cursive script which appears to say something like: "". 2 2 Kilmorden Castle""] On the face of it, it certainly did not appear to be of any importance. Still, I hesitated to throw it away. As I stood there holding it, I involuntarily wrinkled my nose in displeasure.",0
"“At least, au revoir, I should say.” “Exactly. Au revoir!” Whittington looked almost genial again, a reversion that aroused in Tuppence a faint misgiving. “Au revoir, my clever and charming young lady.” Tuppence sped lightly down the stairs. A wild elation possessed her. A neighbouring clock showed the time to be five minutes to twelve. “Let’s give Tommy a surprise!” murmured Tuppence, and hailed a taxi. The cab drew up outside the tube station. Tommy was just within the entrance.",0
"But who was it Daniels or O’Murphy? It must have been one of the two, or why did the car leave the main road? We cannot suppose that the Prime Minister connived at his own assassination! Did O’Murphy take that turning of his own accord, or was it Daniels who told him to do so?” “Surely it must have been O’Murphy’s doing.” “Yes, because if it was Daniels’ the Prime Minister would have heard the order, and would have asked the reason. But there are altogether too many ‘whys’ in this affair, and they contradict each other.",0
"I wonder they dared to there.” He heard the footsteps of his pursuers behind him, and redoubled his own pace. Once he got out of these by-ways he would be safe. There would be a policeman about somewhere not that he really wanted to invoke the aid of the police if he could possibly do without it. It meant explanations, and general awkwardness. In another moment he had reason to bless his luck. He stumbled over a prostrate figure, which started up with a yell of alarm and dashed off down the street. Tommy drew back into a doorway.",0
"The door was shut to again. It was at this juncture that Tommy lost his head. What he ought to have done, what any sane man would have done, was to remain patiently where he was and wait for his man to come out again. What he did do was entirely foreign to the sober common sense which was, as a rule, his leading characteristic. Something, as he expressed it, seemed to snap in his brain. Without a moment’s pause for reflection he, too, went up the steps, and reproduced as far as he was able the peculiar knock. The door swung open with the same promptness as before. A villainous-faced man with close-cropped hair stood in the doorway.",0
"My sympathy had already gone out to her unreservedly. To be left penniless, and with the knowledge that her husband had killed himself to assure her future was a hard burden for any woman to bear. I cherished a secret hope, however, that young Black might prove capable of consoling her after her first grief had passed. He evidently admired her enormously. Our interview with the lady was painful. She refused vehemently to believe the facts that Poirot advanced, and when she was at last convinced broke down into bitter weeping. An examination of the body turned our suspicions into certainty.",0
"They’re only acquaintances really even Suzanne. And whoever wrote that note must have known a great deal. It was not the work of an outsider.” I managed to mention the note this time without blushing at all. “If you would be guided by me” he said, hesitating. “I don’t expect I shall be,” I answered candidly. “But there’s no harm in hearing.” “Do you always do what you like, Miss Beddingfeld?” “Usually,” I replied cautiously. To any one else I would have said “Always.” “I pity your husband,” he said unexpectedly. “You needn’t,” I retorted.",0
“He’s been with me eight years a most trustworthy fellow.” My interlocutor smiled. “We are still at cross-purposes. I refer to the lady.” “Miss Pettigrew?” I exclaimed. “Yes. She has been seen coming out of Agrasato’s Native Curio-shop.” “God bless my soul!” I interrupted. “I was going into that place myself this afternoon. You might have caught me coming out!” There doesn’t seem to be any innocent thing that one can do in Jo’burg without being suspected for it. “Ah! but she has been there more than once and in rather doubtful circumstances.,0
"“I thought you were my secretary,” I objected. “Oh, but I’ve been cut out. You’ve been holding Miss Pettigrew’s hand all the afternoon.” “Whatever I’ve been doing, I can swear I’ve not been doing that,” I assured her. Thursday night. We have just left Kimberley. Race was made to tell the story of the diamond robbery all over again. Why are women so excited by anything to do with diamonds? At last Anne Beddingfeld has shed her veil of mystery. It seems that she’s a newspaper correspondent. She sent an immense cable from De Aar this morning. To judge by the jabbering that went on nearly all night in Mrs. Blair’s cabin, she must have been reading aloud all her special articles for years to come.",0
"In the window was a big roll-top desk strewn with papers at which the master of the house was sitting. He rose as they entered. “You have a message for me? Ah” he recognized Tuppence with a smile “it’s you, is it? Brought a message from Mrs. Vandemeyer, I suppose?” “Not exactly,” said Tuppence. “In fact, I’m afraid I only said that to be quite sure of getting in. Oh, by the way, this is Mr. Hersheimmer, Sir James Peel Edgerton.” “Pleased to meet you,” said the American, shooting out a hand. “Won’t you both sit down?” asked Sir James. He drew forward two chairs.",0
"“It’s a tight fit. Jane’s hand must be a few sizes smaller than mine. I don’t feel anything no say, what’s this? Gee whiz!” And with a flourish he waved aloft a small discoloured packet. “It’s the goods all right. Sewn up in oilskin. Hold it while I get my penknife.” The unbelievable had happened. Tommy held the precious packet tenderly between his hands. They had succeeded! “It’s queer,” he murmured idly, “you’d think the stitches would have rotted. They look just as good as new.” They cut them carefully and ripped away the oilskin. Inside was a small folded sheet of paper.",0
"But is it necessary? I do not believe Madame Renauld to be in league with Madame Daubreuil for several reasons, some of which I have already enumerated to you. The others are self-evident. Therefore, that possibility eliminated, we draw very near to the truth which is, as always, very curious and interesting.” “Poirot,” I cried, “what more do you know?” “Mon ami, you must make your own deductions. You have ‘access to the facts!’ Concentrate your grey cells. Reason not like Giraud but like Hercule Poirot.” “But are you sure?” “My friend, in many ways I have been an imbecile.",0
"""Well, suppose that just as he regains consciousness he sees me disappearing in the distance? Wouldn’t he take it for granted that I was his assailant? Especially as he thought all along it was I he was following?” “It’s possible, yes,” I said slowly. “But it alters all our ideas. And there are other things.” “Most of them are open to explanation. The man who followed you in Cape Town spoke to Pagett, and Pagett looked at his watch. The man might have merely asked him the time.” “It was just a coincidence, you mean?” “Not exactly. There’s a method in all this, connecting Pagett with the affair.",0
"22. The thing I don’t know is how Minks got on to Cabin 17. It must have been sheer instinct.” “And the dispatch to General Smuts? Who tampered with that?” “My dear Anne, you don’t suppose I was going to have a lot of my plans given away, without making an effort to save them? With an escaped murderer as a secretary, I had no hesitation whatever in substituting blanks. Nobody would think of suspecting poor old Pedler.” “What about Colonel Race?” “Yes, that was a nasty jar.",0
"""Exactly, and on the strength of that, you, the examining magistrate, Bex, and every one else, accept the time without further question. But I, Hercule Poirot, say that Madame Renauld lied. The crime took place at least two hours earlier.” “But the doctors ” “They declared, after examination of the body, that death had taken place between ten and seven hours previously. Mon ami, for some reason, it was imperative that the crime should seem to have taken place later than it actually did.",0
"Shall I tell you what made Monsieur Lawrence turn so pale when he first entered his mother’s room on the fatal night? It was because, whilst his mother lay there, obviously poisoned, he saw, over your shoulder, that the door into Mademoiselle Cynthia’s room was unbolted.” “But he declared that he saw it bolted!” I cried. “Exactly,” said Poirot dryly. “And that was just what confirmed my suspicion that it was not. He was shielding Mademoiselle Cynthia.” “But why should he shield her?” “Because he is in love with her.” I laughed.",0
"But now, watching him as he stood, white and limp against the wall, and hearing the damning admission fall from his lips, I doubted no longer. But Poirot had turned to Giraud. “What are your grounds for arresting him?” “Do you expect me to give them to you?” “As a matter of courtesy, yes.” Giraud looked at him doubtfully. He was torn between a desire to refuse rudely and the pleasure of triumphing over his adversary. “You think I have made a mistake, I suppose?” he sneered. “It would not surprise me,” replied Poirot, with a soupçon of malice. Giraud’s face took on a deeper tinge of red. “Eh bien, come in here.",0
"It is undoubtedly the blessed saints who stopped the train. Jump, Hastings, but jump, I tell you."" In an instant he had unfastened the carriage door, and jumped out on the line. ""Throw out the suit-cases and jump yourself."" I obeyed him. Just in time. As I alighted beside him, the train moved on. ""And now Poirot,"" I said, in some exasperation, ""perhaps you will tell me what all this is about."" ""It is, my friend, that I have seen the light."" ""That,"" I said, ""is very illuminating to me."" ""It should be,"" said Poirot, ""but I fear I very much fear that it is not.",0
"Degeneracy, disease never the deliberate embracing of a career by a far-seeing man. Then I considered. Supposing my utmost ambitions were realized that I was called to the bar, and rose to the height of my profession? That I entered politics say, even, that I became Prime Minister of England? What then? Was that power? Hampered at every turn by my colleagues, fettered by the democratic system of which I should be the mere figurehead! No the power I dreamed of was absolute! An autocrat! A dictator! And such power could only be obtained by working outside the law.",0
"""I put it to you that, anxious to prove an alibi, you conceived the idea of a fictitious and rather incredible appointment, and wrote this note yourself in order to bear out your statement!” “No.” “Is it not a fact that, at the time you claim to have been waiting about at a solitary and unfrequented spot, you were really in the chemist’s shop in Styles St. Mary, where you purchased strychnine in the name of Alfred Inglethorp?” “No, that is a lie.” “I put it to you that, wearing a suit of Mr. Inglethorp’s clothes, with a black beard trimmed to resemble his, you were there and signed the register in his name!” “That is absolutely untrue.",0
"At any rate, she decided, it would do no harm just to go and look at the building. Perhaps, then, she could resign herself to waiting patiently for ten o’clock. South Audley Mansions looked exactly the same as usual. What Tuppence had expected she hardly knew, but the sight of its red brick stolidity slightly assuaged the growing and entirely unreasonable uneasiness that possessed her. She was just turning away when she heard a piercing whistle, and the faithful Albert came running from the building to join her. Tuppence frowned.",0
"""Well, what were you doing yourself? Why weren’t you in bed and asleep like a good Christian?” I demanded irritably. “I had been coding those cables of yours, Sir Eustace, and typing the diary up to date.” Trust Pagett to be always in the right and a martyr over it! “Well?” “I just thought I would have a look around before turning in, Sir Eustace. The man was coming down the passage from your cabin. I thought at once there was something wrong by the way he looked about him. He slunk up the stairs by the saloon. I followed him.",0
"""It means that before two equal deductions I chose the wrong one. You heard me say that it would be easy for any one to impersonate Sonia Daviloff because her uncle had not seen her for so many years?"" ""Yes?"" ""Well, precisely the opposite held good also. It was equally easy for any one to impersonate the uncle."" ""What?"" ""Savaronoff did die at the outbreak of the Revolution. The man who pretended to have escaped with such terrible hardships, the man so changed 'that his own friends could hardly recognise him,' the man who successfully laid claim to an enormous fortune "" ""Yes.",0
"“The chauffeur, momentarily taken aback, jammed on the brakes. The Prime Minister put his head out of the window. Instantly a shot rang out then another. The first one grazed his cheek, the second, fortunately, went wide. The chauffeur, now realizing the danger, instantly forged straight ahead, scattering the band of men.” “A near escape,” I ejaculated, with a shiver. “Mr. MacAdam refused to make any fuss over the slight wound he had received. He declared it was only a scratch.",0
"Wells cleared his throat and remarked drily: “Are you so sure it is a coincidence, Cavendish?” “What do you mean?” “Your mother, you tell me, had a violent quarrel with someone yesterday afternoon ” “What do you mean?” cried John again. There was a tremor in his voice, and he had gone very pale. “In consequence of that quarrel, your mother very suddenly and hurriedly makes a new will. The contents of that will we shall never know. She told no one of its provisions. This morning, no doubt, she would have consulted me on the subject but she had no chance.",0
"With the inspiration of genius, I had kicked it once, punched it twice, dented in the crown and affixed to it a thing like a cubist’s dream of a jazz carrot. The result had been distinctly chic. The carrot I had already removed, of course, and now I proceeded to undo the rest of my handiwork. The “Mary” hat resumed its former status with an additional battered appearance which made it even more depressing than formerly. I might as well look as much like the popular conception of an orphan as possible. I was just a shade nervous of Mrs. Flemming’s reception, but hoped my appearance might have a sufficiently disarming effect. Mr. Flemming was nervous too.",0
"“There’s something very queer about all this,” he said. “To begin with, where is Rayburn?” It’s perfectly true that we haven’t seen the fellow since we came on shore. He did not come up to the hotel with us. I decline to believe that he is afraid of Pagett, however. Altogether the whole thing is very annoying. One of my secretaries has vanished into the blue, and the other looks like a disreputable prize-fighter. I can’t take him about with me in his present condition. I shall be the laughing-stock of Cape Town. I have an appointment later in the day to deliver old Milray’s billet-doux, but I shall not take Pagett with me.",0
"He was tramping along the road to Chingside, and sat down in a ditch to rest just before he got into the village. A few minutes later he noticed a man coming along the road to the village, ‘dark-complexioned gent, with a big moustache, one of them city toffs,’ is his description of the man. “Kellett was half concealed from the road by a heap of stones. Just before he got abreast of him, the man looked quickly up and down the road, and seeing it apparently deserted he took a small object from his pocket and threw it over the hedge.",0
"“Why, you surely don’t think you can’t” “The habit of incoherence is growing upon you, Hastings. As a matter of fact I did think. If Ridgeway had been the thief which was perfectly possible the case would have been charming; a piece of neat methodical work.” “But not so charming for Miss Farquhar.” “Possibly you are right. Therefore all is for the best. Now, Hastings, let us review the case. I can see that you are dying to do so. The sealed package is removed from the trunk and vanishes, as Miss Farquhar puts it, into thin air.",0
"“Nurse Edith left with a patient I remember,” he muttered. “My God, to have been so near!” Dr. Hall looked bewildered. “I don’t understand. Is the young lady not with her aunt, after all?” Tuppence shook her head. She was about to speak when a warning glance from Sir James made her hold her tongue. The lawyer rose. “I’m much obliged to you, Hall. We’re very grateful for all you’ve told us. I’m afraid we’re now in the position of having to track Miss Vandemeyer anew. What about the nurse who accompanied her; I suppose you don’t know where she is?” The doctor shook his head.",0
"He stood a step backwards as though involuntarily recoiling from some danger, forgetting that he was standing on the extreme edge of the platform, and went down and over. There was a vivid flash from the rails and a crackling sound. I shrieked. People came running up. Two station officials seemed to materialize from nowhere and took command. I remained where I was, rooted to the spot by a sort of horrible fascination.",0
"I was pleased, for I felt he was making a mistake in trying to work things out so entirely on his own, and I wished to discuss the case with him. But I found he was not communicative. Even when I asked where we were going, he would not answer. Poirot loves being mysterious. He will never part with a piece of information until the last possible moment. In this instance, having taken successively a 'bus and two trains, and arrived in the neighbourhood of one of London's most depressing southern suburbs, he consented at last to explain matters.",0
"In touching terms it requested the pleasure of our company at tea in his sitting-room. The poor man was indeed in a pitiable state. He poured out his troubles to us, encouraged by Suzanne’s sympathetic murmurs. (She does that sort of thing very well.) “First a perfectly strange woman has the impertinence to get herself murdered in my house on purpose to annoy me, I do believe.",0
"Maltravers,” said Dr. Bernard dryly. “Now, gentlemen, if there is nothing further” We took the hint. “Good morning, and many thanks to you, doctor, for so kindly answering our questions. By the way, you saw no need for an autopsy?” “Certainly not.” The doctor became quite apoplectic. “The cause of death was clear, and in my profession we see no need to distress unduly the relatives of a dead patient.” And, turning, the doctor slammed the door sharply in our faces. “And what do you think of Dr. Bernard, Hastings?” inquired Poirot, as we proceeded on our way to the Manor. “Rather an old ass.” “Exactly.",0
"” The magistrate coughed. “You understand, M. Stonor the case is like this. There must be no reservations. You might, perhaps, through a feeling of consideration for Madame Renauld for whom, I gather, you have a great esteem and affection, you might enfin!” said M. Hautet getting rather tied up in his sentence, “there must absolutely be no reservations.” Stonor stared at him, a dawning light of comprehension in his eyes. “I don’t quite get you,” he said gently. “Where does Mrs.",0
"He will give you ten shillings.” The handwriting was Tuppence’s. Tommy appreciated her quick-wittedness in realizing that he might be staying at the inn under an assumed name. He snatched at it. “That’s all right.” The man withheld it. “What about my ten shillings?” Tommy hastily produced a ten-shilling note, and the man relinquished his find. Tommy unfastened it. “DEAR TOMMY, “I knew it was you last night. Don’t go this evening. They’ll be lying in wait for you. They’re taking us away this morning. I heard something about Wales Holyhead, I think. I’ll drop this on the road if I get a chance.",0
"Once I got away from the sanatorium I felt different as though something in me that had been buried for a long time was waking up again. “They sent me in to wait on Mr. Beresford. (Of course I didn’t know his name then.) I was suspicious I thought it was another trap. But he looked so honest, I could hardly believe it. However, I was careful in all I said, for I knew we could be overheard. There’s a small hole, high up in the wall. “But on the Sunday afternoon a message was brought to the house. They were all very disturbed. Without their knowing, I listened.",0
"""Was the will drawn up by a lawyer?” “No; it was written on a printed will-form and witnessed by the man and his wife who live in the house and do for my uncle.” “There might be a possibility of upsetting such a will?” “I would not even attempt to do such a thing.” “You regard it, then, as a sporting challenge on the part of your uncle?” “That is exactly how I look upon it.” “It bears that interpretation, certainly,” said Poirot thoughtfully.",0
"” Another silence. “I like Julius,” essayed Tuppence again. Tommy was suddenly galvanized into life. “You’re not going to marry him, do you hear?” he said dictatorially. “I forbid it.” “Oh!” said Tuppence meekly. “Absolutely, you understand.” “He doesn’t want to marry me he really only asked me out of kindness.” “That’s not very likely,” scoffed Tommy. “It’s quite true. He’s head over ears in love with Jane. I expect he’s proposing to her now.” “She’ll do for him very nicely,” said Tommy condescendingly.",0
"Point No. 1. His nephew is known to be desperately hard up. Point No. 2. His nephew is also known to be shall we say a man of rather loose moral fibre? Point No. 3.” “But Roger Havering is proved to have journeyed straight up to London.” “Précisément and therefore, as Mr. Havering left Elmer’s Dale at 6.15, and since Mr. Pace cannot have been killed before he left, or the doctor would have spotted the time of the crime as being given wrongly when he examined the body, we conclude quite rightly, that Mr. Havering did not shoot his uncle. But there is a Mrs. Havering, Hastings.",0
"A quiet, intelligent-looking man, rather shabbily dressed. The second was of the working classes, and his face was vaguely familiar to the young man. Three minutes later came another, a man of commanding appearance, exquisitely dressed, and evidently well born. His face, again, was not unknown to the watcher, though he could not for the moment put a name to it. After his arrival there was a long wait. In fact Tommy concluded that the gathering was now complete, and was just cautiously creeping out from his hiding-place, when another knock sent him scuttling back to cover.",0
"Renauld came on. “Mother,” cried Jack, starting forward. But with a gesture she drove him back. “I am no mother of yours! You are no son of mine! From this day and hour I renounce you.” “Mother,” cried the lad, stupefied. For a moment she seemed to waver, to falter before the anguish in his voice. Poirot made a mediating gesture, but instantly she regained command of herself. “Your father’s blood is on your head. You are morally guilty of his death. You thwarted and defied him over this girl, and by your heartless treatment of another girl, you brought about his death. Go out from my house.",0
"'They'll do for me, the four of them. They'll do for me yet.'"" ""Eh?"" said Poirot quickly. ""Those were his very words, M. Poirot. He was in great pain at the time, of course, and hardly knew what he was saying."" ""'They'll do for me, the four of them,'"" repeated Poirot thoughtfully. ""What did he mean by 'the four of them,' do you think?"" ""That I can't say, M. Poirot. I thought perhaps he meant his wife and son, and the doctor, and perhaps Miss Clark, Mrs. Templeton's companion.",0
"A secret meeting for orders!” “Don’t hiss at me, Pagett,” I said, drawing back a little, “and do control your breathing. Your idea is absurd. Why should they want to have a secret meeting in the middle of the night? If they’d anything to say to each other, they could hob-nob over beef-tea in a perfectly casual and natural manner.” I could see that Pagett was not in the least convinced. “Something was going on last night, Sir Eustace,” he urged, “or why should Rayburn assault me so brutally.” “You’re quite sure it was Rayburn?” Pagett appeared to be perfectly convinced of that. It was the only part of the story that he wasn’t vague about.",0
"” Boris’s words had aroused a new train of thought in Tommy’s mind. Clearly Whittington was making the journey alone, while the other remained in London. Therefore he was left with a choice as to which he would follow. Obviously, he could not follow both of them unless Like Boris, he glanced up at the clock, and then to the announcement board of the trains. The Bournemouth train left at 3.30. It was now ten past. Whittington and Boris were walking up and down by the bookstall. He gave one doubtful look at them, then hurried into an adjacent telephone box.",0
"Poirot shook his head, refolding the paper. ""No."" We were both immeasurably surprised. ""There is no arsenic in it,"" continued Poirot. ""But there is antimony. And that being the case, we will start immediately for Hertfordshire. Pray Heaven that we are not too late."" It was decided that the simplest plan was for Poirot to represent himself truly as a detective, but that the ostensible reason of his visit should be to question Mrs. Templeton about a servant formerly in her employment whose name he obtained from Nurse Palmer, and who he could represent as being concerned in a jewel robbery.",0
"So far he had aroused no suspicion. But he must decide quickly on his next step. Suppose he were boldly to enter the room on the left of the passage. Would the mere fact of his having been admitted to the house be sufficient? Perhaps a further password would be required, or, at any rate, some proof of identity. The doorkeeper clearly did not know all the members of the gang by sight, but it might be different upstairs. On the whole it seemed to him that luck had served him very well so far, but that there was such a thing as trusting it too far. To enter that room was a colossal risk.",0
"“But so’s some one else! And at last I know who it is!” IN his suite at Claridge’s, Kramenin reclined on a couch and dictated to his secretary in sibilant Russian. Presently the telephone at the secretary’s elbow purred, and he took up the receiver, spoke for a minute or two, then turned to his employer. “Some one below is asking for you.” “Who is it?” “He gives the name of Mr. Julius P. Hersheimmer.” “Hersheimmer,” repeated Kramenin thoughtfully. “I have heard that name before.” “His father was one of the steel kings of America,” explained the secretary, whose business it was to know everything.",0
"""And in what way do you think you could be of use to me?” The man took a card from his pocket and handed it to her with a bow. Tuppence took it and scrutinized it carefully. It bore the inscription, “Mr. Edward Whittington.” Below the name were the words “Esthonia Glassware Co.,” and the address of a city office. Mr. Whittington spoke again: “If you will call upon me to-morrow morning at eleven o’clock, I will lay the details of my proposition before you.” “At eleven o’clock?” said Tuppence doubtfully. “At eleven o’clock.” Tuppence made up her mind. “Very well. I’ll be there.” “Thank you.",0
"""Where is she? What have you done with her out there?"" ""She is in a place of safety where none will find her. As yet, she is unharmed. You observe that I say as yet!"" Cold shivers ran down my spine as I confronted this smiling devil. ""What do you want?"" I cried. ""Money?"" ""My dear Captain Hastings. We have no designs on your small savings, I can assure you. Not pardon me a very intelligent suggestion on your part. Your colleague would not have made it, I fancy."" ""I suppose,"" I said heavily, ""you wanted to get me into your toils. Well, you have succeeded. I have come here with my eyes open.",0
"Somehow or other the Big Four had carried you off. With what object? Clearly not for your beaux yeux equally clearly not because they feared you and wanted to get you out of the way. No, their object was plain. You would be used as a decoy to get the great Hercule Poirot into their clutches. I have long been prepared for something of the kind. I make my little preparations, and presently, sure enough, the messenger arrives such an innocent little street urchin. Me, I swallow everything, and hasten away with him, and, very fortunately, they permit you to come out on the doorstep.",0
"""Have you got the book here?” “Yes, sir.” It was produced; and, with a few words of stern censure, the Coroner dismissed the wretched Mr. Mace. Then, amidst a breathless silence, Alfred Inglethorp was called. Did he realize, I wondered, how closely the halter was being drawn around his neck? The Coroner went straight to the point. “On Monday evening last, did you purchase strychnine for the purpose of poisoning a dog?” Inglethorp replied with perfect calmness: “No, I did not. There is no dog at Styles, except an outdoor sheepdog, which is in perfect health.” “You deny absolutely having purchased strychnine from Albert Mace on Monday last?” “I do.",0
"Her experiments with the nitrogen of the air have been very remarkable, and she has also experimented in the concentration of wireless energy, so that a beam of great intensity can be focused upon some given spot. Exactly how far she has progressed, nobody knows, but it is certain that it is much farther than has ever been given out. She is a genius, that woman the Curies were as nothing to her.",0
"“Not a fool, then, after all! You did that well, girl. But you shall pay for it oh, yes, you shall pay for it! I have a long memory!” “I’m surprised you should have been gulled so easily,” said Tuppence scornfully. “Did you really think I was the kind of girl to roll about on the floor and whine for mercy?” “You may do some day!” said the other significantly. The cold malignity of her manner sent an unpleasant chill down Tuppence’s spine, but she was not going to give in to it. “Supposing we sit down,” she said pleasantly. “Our present attitude is a little melodramatic. No not on the bed. Draw a chair up to the table, that’s right.",0
"And, subtly implying that a jury which did not so decide, was quite unthinkable, Mr. Philips sat down and wiped his forehead. The first witnesses for the prosecution were mostly those who had been called at the inquest, the medical evidence being again taken first. Sir Ernest Heavywether, who was famous all over England for the unscrupulous manner in which he bullied witnesses, only asked two questions. “I take it, Dr. Bauerstein, that strychnine, as a drug, acts quickly?” “Yes.” “And that you are unable to account for the delay in this case?” “Yes.",0
"He held his cap in his hands, twisting it very carefully round and round. His back was much bent, though he was probably not as old as he looked, but his eyes were sharp and intelligent, and belied his slow and rather cautious speech. “Manning,” said John, “this gentleman will put some questions to you which I want you to answer.” “Yessir,” mumbled Manning. Poirot stepped forward briskly. Manning’s eye swept over him with a faint contempt. “You were planting a bed of begonias round by the south side of the house yesterday afternoon, were you not, Manning?” “Yes, sir, me and Willum.” “And Mrs.",0
"Hardly a minute elapsed, however, before the door opened, and a tall man with a lean hawklike face and a tired manner entered the room. “Mr. Y. A.?” he said, and smiled. His smile was distinctly attractive. “Do sit down, both of you.” They obeyed. He himself took a chair opposite to Tuppence and smiled at her encouragingly. There was something in the quality of his smile that made the girl’s usual readiness desert her. As he did not seem inclined to open the conversation, Tuppence was forced to begin.",0
"""Yours faithfully, etc."" I turned the enclosed missive over and over. It was undoubtedly from Poirot. I knew that familiar writing only too well. With a heavy heart, yet a certain eagerness, I tore it open. ""MON CHER AMI (it began), When you receive this I shall be no more. Do not shed tears about me, but follow my orders. Immediately upon receipt of this, return to South America. Do not be pig-headed about this. It is not for sentimental reasons that I bid you undertake the journey. It is necessary.",0
"He goes out on to the lonely golf links, and he digs and then ” “Yes?” “And then,” said Poirot gravely, “the justice that he has so long eluded overtakes him. An unknown hand stabs him in the back.… Now, Hastings, you understand what I mean when I talk of two crimes. The first crime, the crime that M. Renauld, in his arrogance, asked us to investigate (ah, but he made a famous mistake there! He misjudged Hercule Poirot!) is solved. But behind it lies a deeper riddle. And to solve that will be difficult since the criminal in his wisdom, has been content to avail himself of the devices prepared by M.",0
"Why do you still keep me with you?” “Not for the pleasure of your company. I guess you can get right off now if you want to. I thought you’d rather I tooled you back to London.” “You may never reach London,” snarled the other. “Let me go here and now.” “Sure thing. Pull up, George. The gentleman’s not making the return trip. If I ever come to Russia, Monsieur Kramenin, I shall expect a rousing welcome, and ” But before Julius had finished his speech, and before the car had finally halted, the Russian had swung himself out and disappeared into the night. “Just a mite impatient to leave us,” commented Julius, as the car gathered way again.",0
"Renauld’s?” I opened my eyes in surprise. “Anger against his son of course.” “Yet he wrote him affectionate letters to Paris?” “So Jack Renauld says, but he cannot produce them.” “Well, let us pass from that.” “Now we come to the day of the tragedy. You have placed the events of the morning in a certain order. Have you any justification for that?” “I have ascertained that the letter to me was posted at the same time as the telegram was despatched. Masters was informed he could take a holiday shortly afterwards. In my opinion the quarrel with the tramp took place anterior to these happenings.",0
"” There was a pause. “Thank you, Miss Finn.” It was Sir James who spoke. “I hope we have not tired you?” “Oh, that’s all right. My head aches a little, but otherwise I feel fine.” Julius stepped forward and took her hand again. “So long, Cousin Jane. I’m going to get busy after those papers, but I’ll be back in two shakes of a dog’s tail, and I’ll tote you up to London and give you the time of your young life before we go back to the States! I mean it so hurry up and get well.” IN the street they held an informal council of war.",0
"You cannot miss it. A big Villa, overlooking the sea.” We thanked our informant, and drove on, leaving the town behind. A fork in the road brought us to a second halt. A peasant was trudging towards us, and we waited for him to come up to us in order to ask the way again. There was a tiny Villa standing right by the road, but it was too small and dilapidated to be the one we wanted. As we waited, the gate of it swung open and a girl came out. The peasant was passing us now, and the driver leaned forward from his seat and asked for direction.",0
"The sickening anxiety, forgotten for a while in the excitement of knowing Jane Finn was found at last, swept over him again. The lawyer laid down his knife and fork sharply. “Has anything happened to Miss Tuppence?” His voice was keen-edged. “She’s disappeared,” said Julius. “When?” “A week ago.” “How?” Sir James’s questions fairly shot out. Between them Tommy and Julius gave the history of the last week and their futile search. Sir James went at once to the root of the matter. “A wire signed with your name? They knew enough of you both for that.",0
"You and yours will not be molested in any way. I give you my word as to that."" I laughed scornfully. ""And if I refuse to obey your autocratic command?"" ""It is hardly a command. Shall we say that it is a warning?"" There was a cold menace in his tone. ""The first warning,"" he said softly. ""You will be well advised not to disregard it."" Then, before I had any hint of his intention, he rose and slipped quickly away towards the door. I sprang to my feet and was after him in a second, but by bad luck I cannoned straight into an enormously fat man who blocked the way between me and the next table.",0
"He had heard or seen something that had affected him strongly but what was it? I do not usually label myself as dense, but I must confess that nothing out of the ordinary had attracted my attention. In another moment, the door opened and Dorcas appeared. “Mr. Wells to see you, sir,” she said to John. I remembered the name as being that of the lawyer to whom Mrs. Inglethorp had written the night before. John rose immediately. “Show him into my study.” Then he turned to us. “My mother’s lawyer,” he explained. And in a lower voice: “He is also Coroner you understand.",0
"But the cleverness of him! He foresaw every step that a searcher would take that I, miserable imbecile, took. He gets two will-forms, makes the servants sign twice, then sallies out with his will written on the inside of a dirty envelope and a fountain-pen containing his little ink mixture. On some excuse he gets the confectioner and his wife to sign their names under his own signature, then he ties it to the key of his desk and chuckles to himself. If his niece sees through his little ruse, she will have justified her choice of life and elaborate education, and be thoroughly welcome to his money.",0
"""I traced them to the kitchen but not beyond. Point Number One. On the lintel of Robert Grant's door was a faint smear a smear of blood. That's point Number Two. Point Number Three was when I got hold of Grant's boots which he had taken off and fitted them to the marks. That settled it. It was an inside job. I warned Grant and took him into custody; and what do you think I found packed away in his portmanteau? The little jade figures and a ticket-of-leave. Robert Grant was also Abraham Biggs, convicted for felony and housebreaking five years ago.",0
"” Julius drew up a chair to the opposite side of the table, summoned a hovering waiter, and dictated his wishes. Then he turned to Tommy. “Fire ahead. I guess you’ve had some few adventures.” “One or two,” replied Tommy modestly, and plunged into his recital. Julius listened spellbound. Half the dishes that were placed before him he forgot to eat. At the end he heaved a long sigh. “Bully for you. Reads like a dime novel!” “And now for the home front,” said Tommy, stretching out his hand for a peach. “We-el,” drawled Julius, “I don’t mind admitting we’ve had some adventures too.” He, in his turn, assumed the rôle of narrator.",0
"However, the interruption came from another source at the magic word diamonds. “Diamonds!” said Mrs. Blair ecstatically. “Diamonds!” breathed Miss Beddingfeld. They both addressed Colonel Race. “I suppose you’ve been to Kimberley?” I had been to Kimberley too, but I didn’t manage to say so in time. Race was being inundated with questions. What were mines like? Was it true that the natives were kept shut up in compounds? And so on. Race answered their questions and showed a good knowledge of his subject.",0
"The sun had set, and the velvety darkness of the African night was enveloping us like a mantle. “Some of it I know,” I said gently. “What do you know?” “I know that your real name is Harry Lucas.” Still he hesitated not looking at me, but staring straight out in front of him. I had no clue as to what was passing in his mind, but at last he jerked his head forward as though acquiescing in some unspoken decision of his own and began his story. “You are right. My real name is Harry Lucas. My father was a retired soldier who came out to farm in Rhodesia. He died when I was in my second year at Cambridge.” “Were you fond of him?” I asked suddenly.",0
"I should have felt happier if I could have buried him in a cave, with paintings of reindeer and flint implements, but the force of public opinion constrained a neat tomb (with marble slab) in our hideous local churchyard. The vicar’s consolations, though well meant, did not console me in the least. It took some time to dawn upon me that the thing I had always longed for freedom was at last mine. I was an orphan, and practically penniless, but free. At the same time I realized the extraordinary kindness of all these good people. The vicar did his best to persuade me that his wife was in urgent need of a companion help.",0
"He had thick grizzled hair, and a long black cigar (without which, I learned later, he was never seen) protruded rakishly from the corner of his mouth. ""Siddown,"" he grunted. I sat. He tapped the letter in front of him. ""According to this piece here, you're the goods all right, and I don't need to look further. Say, are you well up in the social matters?"" I said that I thought I could satisfy him in that respect.",0
"“You do not think it strange that he should use exactly the same expressions in his letter as Madame Renauld used later in her story? If the mention of Santiago was a blind, why should Renauld speak of it, and what is more send his son there?” “It is puzzling, I admit, but perhaps we shall find some explanation later. We come now to the evening, and the visit of the mysterious lady. I confess that that fairly baffles me, unless it was Madame Daubreuil, as Françoise all along maintained.” Poirot shook his head.",0
"He returned grinning. “That’s all right, miss. We can go along.” He led the way to 17. It was not quite as large as No. 13, but I found it eminently satisfactory. “I’ll fetch your things right away, miss,” said the steward. But at that moment, the man with the sinister face (as I had nicknamed him) appeared in the doorway. “Excuse me,” he said, “but this cabin is reserved for the use of Sir Eustace Pedler.” “That’s all right, sir,” explained the steward. “We’re fitting up No. 13 instead.” “No, it was No. 17 I was to have.” “No. 13 is a better cabin, sir larger.",0
"They were ordinary low-class residents of the district, and they professed bland ignorance of the name Li Chang Yen. A Chinese gentleman had hired them for service in the house by the waterside, and they knew nothing whatever of his private affairs. By the next day I had, except for a slight headache, completely recovered from the effects of Poirot's gas bomb. We went down together to Chinatown and searched the house from which I had been rescued. The premises consisted of two ramshackle houses joined together by an underground passage. The ground floors and the upper stories of each were unfurnished and deserted, the broken windows covered by decaying shutters.",0
"For one thing he probably wouldn’t have believed it. “I made up my mind in a flash. ‘Why, doctor,’ I said, ‘I guess I feel an almighty fool, but I owe it to you to let you know that it wasn’t the Bill Sikes business I was up to.’ Then I went on and mumbled out something about a girl. I trotted out the stern guardian business, and a nervous breakdown, and finally explained that I had fancied I recognized her among the patients at the home, hence my nocturnal adventures. I guess it was just the kind of story he was expecting. ‘Quite a romance,’ he said genially, when I’d finished.",0
"I was aware of my friend looking at me with a quizzical smile, the meaning of which I could not fathom. ""A penny for your thoughts,"" I said lightly. ""I was thinking, my friend, that at midsummer, when you first arrived, you told me that you proposed to be in this country for a couple of months only."" ""Did I say that?"" I asked, rather awkwardly. ""I don't remember."" Poirot's smile broadened. ""You did, mon ami. Since then, you have changed your plan, is it not so?"" ""Er yes, I have.",0
"I like you for that.” “Aren’t you my friend too?” “I am a very bad friend.” “Why do you say that?” “Because it is true. I am charming to my friends one day, and forget all about them the next.” I don’t know what impelled me, but I was nettled, and I said foolishly and not in the best of taste: “Yet you seem to be invariably charming to Dr. Bauerstein!” Instantly I regretted my words. Her face stiffened. I had the impression of a steel curtain coming down and blotting out the real woman.",0
"I went right up to the boat deck, which I believe is a heinous offence, but I decided to dare something in the cause of solitude. We were just steaming into Table Bay. There were fleecy white clouds hovering above Table Mountain, and nestling on the slopes below, right down to the sea, was the sleeping town, gilded and bewitched by the morning sunlight. It made me catch my breath and have that curious hungry pain inside that seizes one sometimes when one comes across something that’s extra beautiful. I’m not very good at expressing these things, but I knew well enough that I had found, if only for a fleeting moment, the thing that I had been looking for ever since I left Little Hampsly.",0

"There was nothing much a handkerchief, keys, notecase filled with notes, and some unimportant letters. But one object standing by itself filled Poirot with interest. ""A chessman!"" he exclaimed. ""A white bishop. Was that in his pocket?"" ""No, clasped in his hand. We had quite a difficulty to get it out of his fingers. It must be returned to Dr. Savaronoff sometime. It's part of a very beautiful set of carved ivory chessmen."" ""Permit me to return it to him. It will make an excuse for my going there."" ""Aha!"" cried Japp.",0
"Of course I am a poor man, and my uncle was a rich one in other words, he paid the piper! But, though exacting in many ways, he was not really hard to get on with, and we all three lived very harmoniously together. Two days ago my uncle, rather wearied with some recent gaieties of ours in town, suggested that we should run down to Derbyshire for a day or two. My wife telegraphed to Mrs. Middleton, the housekeeper, and we went down that same afternoon. Yesterday evening I was forced to return to town, but my wife and my uncle remained on.",0
"A pretty little problem, I must recount it to you one day. He, without doubt, will be able to put us in the way of finding out what we want to know.” It took us some time to run Mr. Aarons to earth, and it was after midnight when we finally managed it. He greeted Poirot with every evidence of warmth, and professed himself ready to be of service to us in any way. “There’s not much about the profession I don’t know,” he said, beaming genially. “Eh bien, M. Aarons, I desire to find a young girl called Bella Duveen.” “Bella Duveen.",0
"“May have been lying around here for weeks. Anyway, it doesn’t interest me.” “I, on the contrary, find it very interesting,” said Poirot sweetly. I guessed that he was merely bent on annoying the Paris detective and, if so, he succeeded. The other turned away rudely, remarking that he had no time to waste, and bending down he resumed his minute search of the ground. Meanwhile Poirot, as though struck by a sudden idea, stepped back over the boundary, and tried the door of the little shed. “That’s locked,” said Giraud over his shoulder. “But it’s only a place where the gardener keeps his rubbish.",0
"At six o’clock, Miss Howard, disguised as Alfred Inglethorp, enters the chemist’s shop, with her story about a dog, obtains the strychnine, and writes the name of Alfred Inglethorp in John’s handwriting, which she had previously studied carefully. “But, as it will never do if John, too, can prove an alibi, she writes him an anonymous note still copying his hand-writing which takes him to a remote spot where it is exceedingly unlikely that anyone will see him. “So far, all goes well. Miss Howard goes back to Middlingham. Alfred Inglethorp returns to Styles.",0
"“When you had that interview with Whittington, they had time before them. I have information that the big coup was planned for early in the new year. But the Government is contemplating legislative action which will deal effectually with the strike menace. They’ll get wind of it soon, if they haven’t already, and it’s possible that that may bring things to a head. I hope it will myself. The less time they have to mature their plans the better. I’m just warning you that you haven’t much time before you, and that you needn’t be cast down if you fail. It’s not an easy proposition anyway.",0
"""But who which was he?” “The man who had a duplicate key, the man who ordered the lock, the man who has not been severely ill with bronchitis at his home in the country enfin, that ‘stodgy’ old man, Mr. Shaw! There are criminals in high places sometimes, my friend. Ah, here we are. Mademoiselle, I have succeeded! You permit?” And, beaming, Poirot kissed the astonished girl lightly on either cheek! I have always considered that one of the most thrilling and dramatic of the many adventures I have shared with Poirot was that of our investigation into the strange series of deaths which followed upon the discovery and opening of the Tomb of King Men-her-Ra.",0
"Of course I had a watch kept on Mr. Inglethorp, hoping that sooner or later he would lead me to the hiding-place. But he was too clever to take any chances. The paper was safe where it was; since no one had thought of looking there in the first week, it was not likely they would do so afterwards. But for your lucky remark, we might never have been able to bring him to justice.” “I understand that now; but when did you first begin to suspect Miss Howard?” “When I discovered that she had told a lie at the inquest about the letter she had received from Mrs. Inglethorp.",0
"“Good. Wait awhile.” About half an hour later, a young woman emerged in brilliant and varied clothing. With a sigh of satisfaction, Poirot tiptoed back into the flat. “C’est ça. After the master and mistress, the maid. The flat should now be empty.” “What are we going to do?” I asked uneasily. Poirot had trotted briskly into the scullery and was hauling at the rope of the coal-lift. “We are about to descend after the method of the dustbins,” he explained cheerfully. “No one will observe us.",0
"You can imagine what a thorn in the flesh I am to him! He just heaved a sigh of relief when the war took me off. You see, there are seven of us at home. It’s awful! All housework and mothers’ meetings! I have always been the changeling. I don’t want to go back, but oh, Tommy, what else is there to do?” Tommy shook his head sadly. There was a silence, and then Tuppence burst out: “Money, money, money! I think about money morning, noon and night! I dare say it’s mercenary of me, but there it is!” “Same here,” agreed Tommy with feeling.",0
"""So would all the friends and admirers of the great M. Hercule Poirot. But regrets, however poignant, do not bring a man to life again."" ""Put very delicately,"" said Poirot, nodding his head. ""And supposing I accept?"" ""In that case I am empowered to offer you compensation."" He drew out a pocket-book, and threw ten notes on the table. They were for ten thousand francs each. ""That is merely as a guarantee of our good faith,"" he said. ""Ten times that amount will be paid you."" ""Good God,"" I cried, springing up, ""you dare to think !"" ""Sit down, Hastings,"" said Poirot autocratically.",0
"But really, I do feel that a man who can get into a rage over such a trifle is, well, dangerous. What do you think I ought to do, Major Neville? You've more experience of the world than I have."" I soothed the girl down, pointed out to her that Mr. Ryland had probably been suffering from the enemy of his race dyspepsia. In the end I sent her away quite comforted. But I was not so easily satisfied myself. When the girl had gone, and I was alone, I took out my notebook, and ran over the letter which I had jotted down.",0
"We have successfully pitted our wits against the late Andrew Marsh’s; but, unfortunately, his niece is no better off for our success.” By driving to the station at once, we were just able to catch a train to London, though not the principal express. Poirot was sad and dissatisfied. For my part, I was tired and dozed in a corner. Suddenly, as we were just moving out of Taunton, Poirot uttered a piercing squeal. “Vite, Hastings! Awake and jump! But jump I say!” Before I knew where I was we were standing on the platform, bareheaded and minus our valises, whilst the train disappeared into the night. I was furious. But Poirot paid no attention.",0
"“My dear child, do you think you can listen to me whilst I try to make a few things clear to you?” “Oh, yes.” “Your father, as you know, was a very great man. Posterity will appreciate him. But he was not a good man of business.” I knew that quite as well, if not better than Mr. Flemming, but I restrained myself from saying so. He continued: “I do not suppose you understand much of these matters. I will try to explain as clearly as I can.” He explained at unnecessary length. The upshot seemed to be that I was left to face life with the sum of £87, 17s. 4d. It seemed a strangely unsatisfying amount. I waited in some trepidation for what was coming next.",0
"Ah! I am through. Is that you, André? It is I, Inez. The little Belgian knows all. Send Halliday to the hotel, and clear out."" She replaced the receiver, and came towards us, smiling. ""You will accompany us to the hotel, madame."" ""Naturally. I expected that."" I got a taxi, and we drove off together. I could see by Poirot's face that he was perplexed. The thing was almost too easy. We arrived at the hotel. The porter came up to us. ""A gentleman has arrived. He is in your rooms. He seems very ill. A nurse came with him, but she has left.",0
"It had no place of origin, and was unsigned. It ran: “In time.” Later in the day the evening papers published an account of the Allied Conference. They laid particular stress on the magnificent ovation accorded to Mr. David MacAdam, whose inspiring speech had produced a deep and lasting impression. Poirot and I were expecting our old friend Inspector Japp of Scotland Yard to tea. We were sitting round the tea-table awaiting his arrival.",0
"If he had gambled with Fate, he was a good gambler. He could lose and smile. “In any case,” he said lightly, “I don’t suppose we shall meet again.” “No,” I said slowly. “I suppose not.” “So good-bye.” “Good-bye.” He gripped my hand hard, just for a minute his curious light eyes seemed to burn into mine, then he turned abruptly and left me. I heard his footsteps ringing along the deck. They echoed and re-echoed. I felt that I should hear them always. Footsteps going out of my life. I can admit frankly that I did not enjoy the next two hours.",0
"Anne, what are you thinking about? You’re frowning so.” “I’m thinking,” I said slowly, “that I almost wish Colonel Race hadn’t made you tell me.” “No. He was right. I owed you the truth.” He paused, then said suddenly: “You know, Anne, I’m jealous of Race. He loves you too and he’s a bigger man than I am or ever shall be.” I turned to him, laughing. “Harry, you idiot. It’s you I want and that’s all that matters.” As soon as possible we started for Cape Town. There Suzanne was waiting to greet me, and we disembowelled the big giraffe together.",0
"We will hope that Mademoiselle Bella will be dealt with leniently, and after all Jack Renauld cannot marry both the girls. I spoke from a professional standpoint. This is not a crime well ordered and regular, such as a detective delights in. The mise en scène designed by Georges Conneau, that indeed is perfect, but the dénouement ah, no! A man killed by accident in a girl’s fit of anger ah, indeed, what order or method is there in that?” And in the midst of a fit of laughter on my part at Poirot’s peculiarities, the door was opened by Françoise. Poirot explained that he must see Mrs.",0
"After a moment or two, I said rather doubtfully: “As to the first points, the question seems to be whether we adopt the theory of blackmail, or of an infatuation for this woman.” “Blackmail, decidedly. You heard what Stonor said as to his character and habits.” “Mrs. Renauld did not confirm his view,” I argued. “We have already seen that Madame Renauld’s testimony cannot be relied upon in any way. We must trust to Stonor on that point.” “Still, if Renauld had an affair with a woman called Bella, there seems no inherent improbability in his having another with Madame Daubreuil.” “None whatever, I grant you, Hastings. But did he?” “The letter, Poirot.",0
"John left me, and a few minutes later I saw him from my window walking slowly across the grass arm in arm with Cynthia Murdoch. I heard Mrs. Inglethorp call “Cynthia” impatiently, and the girl started and ran back to the house. At the same moment, a man stepped out from the shadow of a tree and walked slowly in the same direction. He looked about forty, very dark with a melancholy clean-shaven face. Some violent emotion seemed to be mastering him. He looked up at my window as he passed, and I recognized him, though he had changed much in the fifteen years that had elapsed since we last met. It was John’s younger brother, Lawrence Cavendish.",0
"“Please ask any questions you want to ask, Monsieur Poirot,” said Willard. “We are utterly dumbfounded at this strange series of disasters, but it isn’t it can’t be, anything but coincidence.” There was a nervousness about his manner which rather belied the words. I saw that Poirot was studying him keenly. “Your heart is really in this work, Sir Guy?” “Rather. No matter what happens, or what comes of it, the work is going on. Make up your mind to that.” Poirot wheeled round on the other. “What have you to say to that, monsieur le docteur?” “Well,” drawled the doctor, “I’m not for quitting myself.” Poirot made one of those expressive grimaces of his.",0
"Beresford. I have heard so much about you from Miss Tuppence” he smiled involuntarily “that it really seems as though I already know you quite well.” “Thank you, sir,” said Tommy with his cheerful grin. He scanned the great lawyer eagerly. Like Tuppence, he felt the magnetism of the other’s personality. He was reminded of Mr. Carter. The two men, totally unlike so far as physical resemblance went, produced a similar effect.",0
"You always think you’re going to see and you never do. We crossed the bridge and walked slowly on by the path that was marked out with white stone on either side and led round the brink of the gorge. Finally we arrived in a big clearing where on the left a path led downwards towards the chasm. “The palm gully,” explained Colonel Race. “Shall we go down? Or shall we leave it until to-morrow? It will take some time, and it’s a good climb up again.” “We’ll leave it until to-morrow,” said Sir Eustace with decision. He isn’t at all fond of strenuous physical exercise, I have noticed. He led the way back. As we went, we passed a fine native stalking along.",0
"If O’Murphy is an honest man, why did he leave the main road? But if he was a dishonest man, why did he start the car again when only two shots had been fired thereby, in all probability, saving the Prime Minister’s life? And, again, if he was honest, why did he, immediately on leaving Charing Cross, drive to a well-known rendezvous of German spies?” “It looks bad,” I said. “Let us look at the case with method. What have we for and against these two men? Take O’Murphy first.",0
"All around me I seemed to feel an atmosphere of evil, subtle and menacing. A horrible thought flashed across me. Supposing I were the next? “Mon Dieu,” said Poirot, in a very low voice, “I do not understand this. It is horrible. Tell me, monsieur, there is no doubt that it was tetanus?” “I believe not. But Dr. Ames will tell you more than I can do.” “Ah, of course, you are not the doctor.” “My name is Tosswill.” This, then, was the British expert described by Lady Willard as being a minor official at the British Museum. There was something at once grave and steadfast about him that took my fancy. “If you will come with me,” continued Dr.",0
"“I am not a child, monsieur. I can be brave and look facts in the face. He is innocent, and we must save him.” She spoke with a kind of desperate energy, then was silent, frowning as she thought. “Mademoiselle,” said Poirot observing her keenly, “is there not something that you are keeping back that you could tell us?” She nodded perplexedly. “Yes, there is something, but I hardly know whether you will believe it it seems so absurd.” “At any rate, tell us, mademoiselle.” “It is this. M. Giraud sent for me, as an afterthought, to see if I could identify the man in there.” She signed with her head towards the shed.",0
"The Pacifist propaganda, started and maintained by the German agents in our midst, has been very active. It is the universal opinion that the turning point of the Conference will be the strong personality of the Prime Minister. His absence may have the most serious results possibly a premature and disastrous peace. And we have no one who can be sent in his place. He alone can represent England.” Poirot’s face had grown very grave. “Then you regard the kidnapping of the Prime Minister as a direct attempt to prevent his being present at the Conference?” “Most certainly I do. He was actually on his way to France at the time.” “And the Conference is to be held?” “At nine o’clock to-morrow night.",0
"” The lawyer paused, then continued: “I asked him if the photograph bore the name and address of a Californian photographer. He replied: ‘You’re on to it, sir. It had.’ Then he went on to tell me something I didn’t know. The original of that photograph was the French girl, Annette, who saved his life.” “What?” “Exactly. I asked the young man with some curiosity what he had done with the photograph. He replied that he had put it back where he found it.” The lawyer paused again. “That was good, you know distinctly good. He can use his brains, that young fellow.",0
"The house and furniture had been sold, and the amount realized had just covered our debts. As yet, I had not been successful in finding a post. Not that I really wanted one! I had the firm conviction that, if I went about looking for adventure, adventure would meet me halfway. It is a theory of mine that one always gets what one wants. My theory was about to be proved in practice. It was early in January the 8th, to be exact. I was returning from an unsuccessful interview with a lady who said she wanted a secretary-companion, but really seemed to require a strong charwoman who would work twelve hours a day for £25 a year.",0
"I realized that as we went up the stairs of the tall house in a quiet Kensington Square. Mrs. Flemming greeted me pleasantly enough. She was a stout, placid woman of the “good wife and mother” type. She took me up to a spotless chintz-hung bedroom, hoped I had everything I wanted, informed me that tea would be ready in about a quarter of an hour, and left me to my own devices. I heard her voice, slightly raised, as she entered the drawing-room below on the first floor. “Well, Henry, why on earth” I lost the rest, but the acerbity of the tone was evident.",0
"When the news of my husband’s death came I was ill. My son, who has just come down from Oxford, went out there. He brought the the body home, but now he has gone out again, in spite of my prayers and entreaties. He is so fascinated by the work that he intends to take his father’s place and carry on the system of excavations. You may think me a foolish, credulous woman, but, Monsieur Poirot, I am afraid. Supposing that the spirit of the dead King is not yet appeased? Perhaps to you I seem to be talking nonsense” “No, indeed, Lady Willard,” said Poirot quickly.",0
"""And the point of all this?” sneered Giraud. “That when you have two crimes precisely similar in design and execution, you find the same brain behind them both. I am looking for that brain, M. Giraud and I shall find it. Here we have a true clue a psychological clue. You may know all about cigarettes and match ends, M. Giraud, but I, Hercule Poirot, know the mind of man!” And the ridiculous little fellow tapped his forehead with emphasis. Giraud remained singularly unimpressed. “For your guidance,” continued Poirot, “I will also advise you of one fact which might fail to be brought to your notice.",0
"Confound the fellow and his prowling ways. Altogether I am decidedly out of temper. I had poisonous breakfast with poisonous people. Dutch waitresses with thick ankles who took half an hour to bring me a bad bit of fish. And this farce of getting up at 5 a.m. on arrival at the port to see a blinking doctor and hold your hands above your head simply makes me tired. Later. A very serious thing has occurred. I went to my appointment with the Prime Minister, taking Milray’s sealed letter. It didn’t look as though it had been tampered with, but inside was a blank sheet of paper! Now, I suppose, I’m in the devil of a mess.",0
"There was the sound of feet on the stairs, the door was flung open, and Harry Rayburn was hustled into the room between two men. Sir Eustace flung me a look of triumph. “According to plan,” he said softly. “You amateurs will pit yourselves against professionals.” “What’s the meaning of this?” cried Harry hoarsely. “It means that you have walked into my parlour said the spider to the fly,” remarked Sir Eustace facetiously. “My dear Rayburn, you are extraordinarily unlucky.” “You said I could come safely, Anne?” “Do not reproach her, my dear fellow. That note was written at my dictation, and the lady could not help herself.",0
"Tomorrow I intend to take such steps as shall make it certain that you shall never touch a penny of his money. Make your way in the world as best you can with the help of the girl who is the daughter of your father’s bitterest enemy!” And slowly, painfully, she retraced her way upstairs. We were all dumbfounded totally unprepared for such a demonstration. Jack Renauld, worn out with all he had already gone through, swayed and nearly fell. Poirot and I went quickly to his assistance. “He is overdone,” murmured Poirot to Marthe.",0
"We both fell for her right away, and we both took it hard. It was the first shadow that had ever come between us but even then it didn’t weaken our friendship. Each of us, I honestly believe, was willing to stand aside for the other to go in and win. But that wasn’t her game. Sometimes, afterwards, I wondered why it hadn’t been, for Sir Laurence Eardsley’s only son was quite a parti. But the truth of it was that she was married to a sorter in De Beers’ though nobody knew of it.",0
"""They’re a bad lot, Annette. If you’ll help me, I’ll take you away from the lot of them. And you’d probably get a good whack of money.” But the girl merely shook her head. “I dare not, monsieur; I am afraid of them.” She turned away. “Wouldn’t you do anything to help another girl?” cried Tommy. “She’s about your age too. Won’t you save her from their clutches?” “You mean Jane Finn?” “Yes.” “It is her you came here to look for? Yes?” “That’s it.” The girl looked at him, then passed her hand across her forehead. “Jane Finn. Always I hear that name. It is familiar.",0
"“Visitors were not permitted below at that hour, so, in spite of my many apologies, Mademoiselle Cynthia’s colleague had to go down and fetch it for me.” “Then you knew what you were going to find?” “No, not at all. I merely realized that it was possible, from your story, for Monsieur Lawrence to go to the poison cupboard. The possibility had to be confirmed, or eliminated.” “Poirot,” I said, “your gaiety does not deceive me. This is a very important discovery.” “I do not know,” said Poirot. “But one thing does strike me. No doubt it has struck you too.",0
"He was a tall man, obviously a Dutchman, with a flaming orange beard. He did not look in the least like the curator of a museum. In fact, I realized in a flash that I had made a fool of myself. I was in the hands of the enemy. It reminded me forcibly of Episode III in “The Perils of Pamela.” How often had I not sat in the sixpenny seats, eating a twopenny bar of milk chocolate, and yearning for similar things to happen to me. Well, they had happened with a vengeance. And somehow it was not nearly so amusing as I had imagined. It’s all very well on the screen you have the comfortable knowledge that there’s bound to be an Episode IV.",0
"He was one of the few people who were capable of making me feel shy. I went down to my cabin and began looking for a broad band of ribbon, or a motor-veil, with which I could restrain my rebellious locks. Now I am a tidy person, I like my things always arranged in a certain way and I keep them so. I had no sooner opened my drawer than I realized that somebody had been disarranging my things. Everything had been turned over and scattered. I looked in the other drawers and the small hanging cupboard. They told me the same tale.",0
"He rattled off the formula to the elderly woman, looking more like a housekeeper than a servant, who opened the door to him. “Christian name?” “Margaret.” Tommy spelt it, but the other interrupted him. “No, g u e.” “Oh, Marguerite; French way, I see.” He paused, then plunged boldly. “We had her down as Rita Vandemeyer, but I suppose that’s incorrect?” “She’s mostly called that, sir, but Marguerite’s her name.” “Thank you. That’s all. Good morning.” Hardly able to contain his excitement, Tommy hurried down the stairs. Tuppence was waiting at the angle of the turn. “You heard?” “Yes. Oh, Tommy!” Tommy squeezed her arm sympathetically. “I know, old thing.",0
"“By and by she went out of the room altogether. I was suspicious still, and lay quite quiet for some time. In the end, however, I got up and walked round the room, examining it. I thought that even if anyone was watching me from somewhere, it would seem natural enough under the circumstances. It was a squalid, dirty place. There were no windows, which seemed queer. I guessed the door would be locked, but I didn’t try it. There were some battered old pictures on the walls, representing scenes from Faust.” Jane’s two listeners gave a simultaneous “Ah!” The girl nodded.",0
"It was not until the evening of the day following that I was able to stagger feebly into an adjoining room, and view with deep emotion the plain elm coffin which held the remains of one of the most marvellous men this world has ever known. From the very first moment of regaining consciousness I had only one purpose in mind to avenge Poirot's death, and to hunt down the Big Four remorselessly. I had thought that Ridgeway would have been of one mind with me about this, but to my surprise the good doctor seemed unaccountably lukewarm. ""Get back to South America"" was his advice, tendered on every occasion.",0
"Renauld’s own plans for throwing the police off the track. The great criminal (as you may remember my remarking to you once) is always supremely simple.” I nodded. “Now, to support this theory, the criminal must have been fully cognizant of Mr. Renauld’s plans. That leads us to Madame Renauld. But facts fail to support any theory of her guilt. Is there any one else who might have known of them? Yes. From Marthe Daubreuil’s own lips we have the admission that she overheard M. Renauld’s quarrel with the tramp.",0
"“Not the poison of the Borgias,” replied Poirot, with a twinkle. “I see your imagination mounting. I should say it was French chalk.” “French chalk?” “Yes, cabinet-makers use it to make drawers run smoothly.” I laughed. “You old sinner! I thought you were working up to something exciting.” “Au revoir, my friend. I save myself. I fly!” The door shut behind him. With a smile, half of derision, half of affection, I picked up the coat, and stretched out my hand for the clothes-brush. The next morning, hearing nothing from Poirot, I went out for a stroll, met some old friends, and lunched with them at their hotel.",0
"“And he will be able, at his leisure, to come back and destroy this solitary piece of evidence against him.” “Then, all the time, it was in the spill vase in Mrs. Inglethorp’s bedroom, under our very noses?” I cried. Poirot nodded. “Yes, my friend. That is where I discovered my ‘last link,’ and I owe that very fortunate discovery to you.” “To me?” “Yes. Do you remember telling me that my hand shook as I was straightening the ornaments on the mantelpiece?” “Yes, but I don’t see ” “No, but I saw. Do you know, my friend, I remembered that earlier in the morning, when we had been there together, I had straightened all the objects on the mantelpiece.",0
"“I don’t know.” Then he flushed and went on with sudden vehemence: “Why do I say that? I did love my father. We said bitter things to each other the last time I saw him, and we had many rows over my wildness and my debts, but I cared for the old man. I know how much now when it’s too late,” he continued more quietly. “It was at Cambridge that I met the other fellow” “Young Eardsley?” “Yes young Eardsley. His father, as you know, was one of South Africa’s most prominent men. We drifted together at once, my friend and I.",0
"He conceals his intelligence, you comprehend, but it is profound for all that."" Harvey looked at me with due appreciation, and I felt rather uncomfortable. ""All is in train, then,"" said Poirot. He was pale now, and completely serious. ""The time has come. The arrangements are all made?"" ""Everything you ordered has been carried out. The governments of Italy, France and England are behind you, and are all working harmoniously together."" ""It is, in fact, a new Entente,"" observed Poirot dryly. ""I am glad that Desjardeaux is convinced at last. Eh bien, then, we will start or rather, I will start.",0
"“But surely the study of finger-prints and footprints, cigarette ash, different kinds of mud, and other clues that comprise the minute observation of details all these are of vital importance?” “But certainly. I have never said otherwise. The trained observer, the expert, without doubt he is useful! But the others, the Hercules Poirots, they are above the experts! To them the experts bring the facts, their business is the method of the crime, its logical deduction, the proper sequence and order of the facts; above all, the true psychology of the case.",0
"“Paris!” “Suzanne,” I said, “very soon you’ll have had enough of South Africa and adventure.” “I should like a really nice hat,” admitted Suzanne wistfully. “Shall I come with you to meet Guy Pagett to-morrow?” “I prefer to go alone. He’d be shyer speaking before two of us.” So it came about that I was standing in the doorway of the hotel on the following afternoon, struggling with a recalcitrant parasol that refused to go up, whilst Suzanne lay peacefully on her bed with a book and a basket of fruit.",0
"""Of course, he's always rather irritable and short tempered. That one expects. It's all in the day's work. But to fly into such an absolute fury over nothing at all. He really looked as though he could have murdered me! And, as I say, over nothing at all!"" ""Tell me about it?"" I said, keenly interested. ""As you know, I open all Mr. Ryland's letters. Some I hand on to Mr. Appleby, others I deal with myself, but I do all the preliminary sorting. Now there are certain letters that come, written on blue paper, and with a tiny 4 marked on the corner I beg your pardon, did you speak?"" I had been unable to repress a stifled exclamation, but I hurriedly shook my head, and begged her to continue.",0
"""Pardon, monsieur, for interrupting, but was that a common practice of his?” “No, it was not, but old Françoise has the common idea as regards the English that they are mad, and liable to do the most unaccountable things at any moment! Going to call her mistress as usual, a younger maid, Léonie, was horrified to discover her gagged and bound, and almost at the same moment news was brought that M. Renauld’s body had been discovered, stone dead, stabbed in the back.” “Where?” “That is one of the most extraordinary features of the case. M. Poirot, the body was lying, face downwards, in an open grave.",0

Potass Bromide . . . . . . . 3vi Aqua ad. . . . . . . . . . . . . 3viii Fiat Mistura This solution deposits in a few hours the greater part of the strychnine salt as an insoluble bromide in transparent crystals. A lady in England lost her life by taking a similar mixture: the precipitated strychnine collected at the bottom, and in taking the last dose she swallowed nearly all of it! “Now there was, of course, no bromide in Dr. Wilkins’ prescription, but you will remember that I mentioned an empty box of bromide powders.",0
"""But why?” “Because if Ridgeway merely opens the packet and finds it a dummy, suspicion flies at once to London. No, the man on board in the cabin next door does his work, pretends to force the lock in an obvious manner so as to draw immediate attention to the theft, really unlocks the trunk with a duplicate key, throws the package overboard and waits until the last to leave the boat. Naturally he wears glasses to conceal his eyes, and is an invalid since he does not want to run the risk of meeting Ridgeway. He steps ashore in New York and returns by the first boat available.",0
"Our tiny local library suddenly made up its mind to have an assistant librarian. Finally, the doctor called upon me, and after making various ridiculous excuses for failing to send in a proper bill, he hummed and hawed a good deal and suddenly suggested that I should marry him. I was very much astonished. The doctor was nearer forty than thirty, and a round, tubby little man. He was not at all like the hero of “The Perils of Pamela,” and even less like a stern and silent Rhodesian. I reflected a minute and then asked him why he wanted to marry me.",0
"""Oh, come,"" I protested, ""isn't that a bit farfetched? How would a Chinaman cut any ice in Russia?"" Poirot frowned at me irritably. ""For you, Hastings,"" he said, ""everything is farfetched that comes not from your own imagination; for me, I agree with this gentleman. But continue, I pray, monsieur."" ""What exactly he hopes to get out of it all I cannot pretend to say for certain,"" went on Mr. Ingles; ""but I assume his disease is one that has attacked great brains from the time of Akbar and Alexander to Napoleon a lust for power and personal supremacy.",0
"Perhaps you could call and see me at the above address at eleven o’clock to-morrow morning. “Yours truly, “A. CARTER.” “27 Carshalton Gardens,” said Tuppence, referring to the address. “That’s Gloucester Road way. Plenty of time to get there if we tube.” “The following,” said Tommy, “is the plan of campaign. It is my turn to assume the offensive. Ushered into the presence of Mr. Carter, he and I wish each other good morning as is customary. He then says: ‘Please take a seat, Mr. er?’ To which I reply promptly and significantly: ‘Edward Whittington!’ whereupon Mr.",0
"And the object of this journey?” “I have no idea, M. le juge.” “What?” “No. See, here is the telegram.” The magistrate took it and read it aloud. “‘Proceed immediately Cherbourg embark Anzora sailing tonight Buenos Ayres. Ultimate destination Santiago. Further instructions will await you Buenos Ayres. Do not fail. Matter is of utmost importance. Renauld.’ And there had been no previous correspondence on the matter?” Jack Renauld shook his head. “That is the only intimation of any kind. I knew, of course, that my father, having lived so long out there, had necessarily many interests in South America. But he had never mooted any suggestion of sending me out.",0
"There I was received courteously, but got no further information. The commander's instructions were to land me at a certain spot on the Belgian coast. There his knowledge and responsibility ended. The whole thing was like a dream. The one idea I held to firmly was that all this must be part of Poirot's plan. I must simply go forward blindly, trusting in my dead friend. I was duly landed at the spot indicated. There a motor was waiting, and soon I was rapidly whirling along across the flat Flemish plains. I slept that night at a small hotel in Brussels. The next day we went on again. The country became wooded and hilly.",0
"“But it’s been happy, hasn’t it?” “Happy? It’s been hell!” “As bad as that!” “What do you torment me for? Why are you mocking at me? Why do you say that laughing into your hair?” “I wasn’t laughing. And I’m not mocking. If you want me to go, I’ll go. But if you want me to stay I’ll stay.” “Not that!” he cried vehemently. “Not that. Don’t tempt me, Anne. Do you realize what I am? A criminal twice over. A man hunted down. They know me here as Harry Parker they think I’ve been away on a trek up country, but any day they may put two and two together and then the blow will fall.",0
"Our inquiries necessarily went over old ground, and we learnt little to add to what Mrs. Halliday had already told us. Poirot had a lengthy interview with Professor Bourgoneau, during which he sought to elicit whether Halliday had mentioned any plan of his own for the evening, but we drew a complete blank. Our next source of information was the famous Madame Olivier. I was quite excited as we mounted the steps of her villa at Passy. It has always seemed to me extraordinary that a woman should go so far in the scientific world. I should have thought a purely masculine brain was needed for such work.",0
"But, if it’s all so long ago, and the war’s over, what does it matter now?” “I guess history repeats itself, Jane. First there was a great hue and cry over those papers, then it all died down, and now the whole caboodle’s started all over again for rather different reasons. Then you can hand them over to us right away?” “But I can’t.” “What?” “I haven’t got them.” “You haven’t got them?” Julius punctuated the words with little pauses. “No I hid them.” “You hid them?” “Yes. I got uneasy. People seemed to be watching me. It scared me badly.” She put her hand to her head.",0
"One to be carried out if my interview there was unsatisfactory (it had been profoundly unsatisfactory). That is, if I had the nerve to go through with it. Things that one would shrink from attempting normally are easily tackled in a flush of anger. Without giving myself time to reflect, I walked straight to the house of Lord Nasby. Lord Nasby was the millionaire owner of the Daily Budget. He owned other papers several of them, but the Daily Budget was his special child. It was as the owner of the Daily Budget that he was known to every householder in the United Kingdom.",0
"""How tall was he, do you think? About six foot?” “I should say so maybe.” “He was clean-shaven, you say?” “Yes, miss not even one of these toothbrush moustaches.” “Was his chin at all shiny?” I asked on a sudden impulse. Mrs. James stared at me with awe. “Well, now you come to mention it, miss, it was. However did you know?” “It’s a curious thing, but murderers often have shiny chins,” I explained wildly. Mrs. James accepted the statement in all good faith. “Really, now, miss. I never heard that before.” “You didn’t notice what kind of a head he had, I suppose?” “Just the ordinary kind, miss.",0
""" He went across to the telephone as he finished speaking, and gave a number which I knew to be that of a private detective agency which he sometimes employed. His instructions were clear and definite. Two men were to go to the address he gave, and, in general terms, were to watch over the safety of Miss Monro. They were to follow her wherever she went. Poirot hung up the receiver and came back to me. ""Do you really think that necessary, Poirot?"" I asked. ""It may be. There is no doubt that we are watched, you and I, and since that is so, they will soon know with whom we were lunching to-day. And it is possible that Number Four will scent danger.",0
"""Well,” said Tommy, picking up the Daily Mail again, “do it. I shan’t stop you.” “You see,” continued Tuppence. “I’ve been thinking ” She was interrupted by a fresh bout of applause. “It’s all very well for you to sit there being funny, Tommy. It would do you no harm to do a little brain work too.” “My union, Tuppence, my union! It does not permit me to work before 11 a.m.” “Tommy, do you want something thrown at you? It is absolutely essential that we should without delay map out a plan of campaign.” “Hear, hear!” “Well, let’s do it.” Tommy laid his paper finally aside.",0
"""If it is humanly possible, the Prime Minister shall be there. God grant it is not too late. Now, messieurs, recount to me everything from the beginning. I must know about this shooting affair as well.” “Last night, the Prime Minister, accompanied by one of his secretaries, Captain Daniels” “The same who accompanied him to France?” “Yes. As I was saying, they motored down to Windsor, where the Prime Minister was granted an Audience. Early this morning, he returned to town, and it was on the way that the attempted assassination took place.” “One moment, if you please. Who is this Captain Daniels? You have his dossier?” Lord Estair smiled.",0
"But I saw his eyes searching in the shadows. ""My friend? He is here?"" ""Yes, you are both in the trap the trap of the Big Four."" He laughed. ""A trap?"" queried Poirot. ""Say, haven't you tumbled to it yet?"" ""I comprehend that there is a trap yes,"" said Poirot gently. ""But you are in error, monsieur. It is you who are in it not I and my friend."" ""What?"" Ryland raised the big automatic, but I saw his gaze falter. ""If you fire, you commit murder watched by ten pairs of eyes, and you will be hanged for it. This place is surrounded has been for the last hour by Scotland Yard men.",0
"But you are so artful. You want me to help you and yet you drag the red kipper across the trail."" Japp burst out laughing. ""That's you all over, Mr. Poirot. Yes, I'd bet on the Chink, I'll admit it now. It stands to reason that it was he who doctored the curry, and if he'd try once in an evening to get his master out of the way, he'd try twice."" ""I wonder if he would,"" said Poirot softly. ""But it's the motive that beats me. Some heathen revenge or other, I suppose."" ""I wonder,"" said Poirot again. ""There has been no robbery? Nothing has disappeared? No jewellery, or money, or papers?"" ""No that is, not exactly.",0
"“That’s it,” he continued. “You heard, Hastings? And you, Everett? Oh, by the way, this is Mr. Everett, rather a fine member of the theatrical profession. I ’phoned to him this afternoon. His make-up is good, isn’t it? Quite like the dead man, and with a pocket torch and the necessary phosphorescence he made the proper impression. I shouldn’t touch her right hand if I were you, Hastings. Red paint marks so. When the lights went out I clasped her hand, you see. By the way, we mustn’t miss our train. Inspector Japp is outside the window.",0
"As to salary, shall we say at the rate of three hundred a year? And an equal sum for Mr. Beresford, of course.” Tuppence beamed upon him. “How lovely. You are kind. I do love money! I’ll keep beautiful accounts of our expenses all debit and credit, and the balance on the right side, and red line drawn sideways with the totals the same at the bottom. I really know how to do it when I think.” “I’m sure you do. Well, good-bye, and good luck to you both.” He shook hands with them, and in another minute they were descending the steps of 27 Carshalton Terrace with their heads in a whirl. “Tommy! Tell me at once, who is ‘Mr.",0
"” Rather an odd expression passed over the Colonel’s face. “He’s got a little trouble of his own to attend to which is keeping him busy.” “Tell us about it.” “I mustn’t tell tales out of school.” “Tell us something even if you have to invent it for our special benefit.” “Well, what would you say to the famous ‘Man in the Brown Suit’ having made the voyage with us?” “What?” I felt the colour die out of my face and then surge back again. Fortunately Colonel Race was not looking at me. “It’s a fact, I believe.",0
"It proved unexpectedly difficult. Her name was Jane Finn, and it duly appeared among the list of the survivors, but the girl herself seemed to have vanished completely. Inquiries into her antecedents did little to help us. She was an orphan, and had been what we should call over here a pupil teacher in a small school out West. Her passport had been made out for Paris, where she was going to join the staff of a hospital. She had offered her services voluntarily, and after some correspondence they had been accepted.",0
"Twice Tommy turned his head uneasily. Julius looked back. “What is it?” “I don’t know. I’ve got the wind up somehow. Keep fancying there’s some one following us.” “Can’t be,” said Julius positively. “We’d see him.” Tommy had to admit that this was true. Nevertheless, his sense of uneasiness deepened. In spite of himself he believed in the omniscience of the enemy. “I rather wish that fellow would come along,” said Julius. He patted his pocket. “Little William here is just aching for exercise!” “Do you always carry it him with you?” inquired Tommy with burning curiosity.",0
"But I would give a considerable sum of money for a drink! I wonder if Pagett will have the sense to bring a bottle of whisky with him when he arrives to-morrow? I put on my hat and went out, intending to buy a few souvenirs. The curio-shops in Jo’burg are rather pleasant. I was just studying a window full of imposing karosses, when a man coming out of the shop cannoned into me. To my surprise it turned out to be Race. I can’t flatter myself that he looked pleased to see me. As a matter of fact, he looked distinctly annoyed, but I insisted on his accompanying me back to the hotel.",0
"If she could overhear that, there is no reason why she should not have heard everything else, especially if M. and Madame Renauld were imprudent enough to discuss their plans sitting on the bench. Remember how easily you overheard Marthe’s conversation with Jack Renauld from that spot.” “But what possible motive could Marthe have for murdering Mr. Renauld?” I argued. “What motive? Money! M. Renauld was a millionaire several times over, and at his death (or so she and Jack believed) half that vast fortune would pass to his son. Let us reconstruct the scene from the standpoint of Marthe Daubreuil. “Marthe Daubreuil overhears what passes between Renauld and his wife.",0
"Was it Sir Eustace who had been subjected to a test, or had the story been told for my benefit? I remembered the impression I had received on that former night of having been deliberately “pumped.” For some reason or other, Colonel Race was suspicious. But where did he come in? What possible connection could he have with the affair? “Who is Colonel Race?” I asked. “That’s rather a question,” said Suzanne. “He’s pretty well known as a big-game hunter, and, as you heard him say to-night, he was a distant cousin of Sir Laurence Eardsley. I’ve never actually met him until this trip.",0
"Julius before the safe in the flat, her own question and the pause before his reply, “Nothing.” Was there really nothing? Or had he found something he wished to keep to himself? If he could make a reservation, so could she. “Nothing particular,” she replied. She felt rather than saw Julius throw a sideways glance at her. “Say, shall we go for a spin in the park?” “If you like.” For a while they ran on under the trees in silence. It was a beautiful day. The keen rush through the air brought a new exhilaration to Tuppence.",0
"“Take off the brown one and put on the other black one. And don’t forget your muffler. It’s a very cold day.” In a few minutes Papa stalked off, correctly booted and well mufflered. He returned late that evening, and, to my dismay, I saw his muffler and overcoat were missing. “Dear me, Anne, you are quite right. I took them off to go into the cavern. One gets so dirty there.” I nodded feelingly, remembering an occasion when Papa had returned literally plastered from head to foot with rich Pleiocene clay.",0
"I had cherished high hopes that we would find documents of importance. A list, perhaps, of some of the more important agents of the Big Four, or cipher notes of some of their plans, but we discovered nothing of the kind. The only papers we found in the whole place were the notes which the Chinaman had consulted whilst he was dictating the letter to Poirot. These consisted of a very complete record of each of our careers, and estimate of our characters, and suggestions about the weaknesses through which we might best be attacked. Poirot was most childishly delighted with this discovery.",0
"Whatever grudge there might have been would have been on Mr. Davenheim’s side.” “Well, you can’t deny that he lied about never having left the study?” “No. But he may have been frightened. Remember, the missing man’s clothes had just been discovered in the lake. Of course, as usual, he would have done better to speak the truth.” “And the fourth point?” “I grant you that. If Kellett’s story is true, Lowen is undeniably implicated. That is what makes the affair so very interesting.” “Then I did appreciate one vital fact?” “Perhaps but you have entirely overlooked the two most important points, the ones which undoubtedly hold the clue to the whole matter.",0
"“Think of buying old furniture, and bright carpets, and futurist silk curtains, and a polished dining-table, and a divan with lots of cushions.” “Hold hard,” said Tommy. “What’s all this for?” “Possibly a house but I think a flat.” “Whose flat?” “You think I mind saying it, but I don’t in the least! Ours, so there!” “You darling!” cried Tommy, his arms tightly round her. “I was determined to make you say it. I owe you something for the relentless way you’ve squashed me whenever I’ve tried to be sentimental.” Tuppence raised her face to his. The taxi proceeded on its course round the north side of Regent’s Park.",0
"It is not Madame Daubreuil who tells us this tale if it were all would indeed be plain sailing it is Madame Renauld. Is she then in league with the other?” “I can’t believe that,” I said slowly. “If it is so, she must be the most consummate actress the world has ever known.” “Ta-ta-ta,” said Poirot impatiently. “Again you have the sentiment, and not the logic! If it is necessary for a criminal to be a consummate actress, then by all means assume her to be one.",0
"Yes, yes, very interesting, very ingenious."" We set out forthwith. Mr. Ingles and the Inspector forged ahead. I drew Poirot back a little so as to be able to speak to him out of the Inspector's hearing. ""What do you really think, Poirot. Is there more in this than meets the eye?"" ""That is just the question, mon ami. Whalley says plainly enough in his letter that the Big Four are on his track, and we know, you and I, that the Big Four is no bogey for the children. Yet everything seems to say that this man Grant committed the crime.",0
"By its terms, Crabtree Manor and its contents are to be at my disposal for a year from his death ‘during which time my clever niece may prove her wits,’ the actual words run. At the end of that period, ‘my wits having proved better than hers,’ the house and all my uncle’s large fortune pass to various charitable institutions.” “That is a little hard on you, mademoiselle, seeing that you were Mr. Marsh’s only blood relation.” “I do not look on it in that way. Uncle Andrew warned me fairly, and I chose my own path. Since I would not fall in with his wishes, he was at perfect liberty to leave his money to whom he pleased.",0
"Sum income.” “Oh, I I haven’t quite worked that out.” “What about me?” “You?” “Sure thing.” “Oh, I couldn’t!” “Why not?” “I tell you I couldn’t.” “Again, why not?” “It would seem so unfair.” “I don’t see anything unfair about it. I call your bluff, that’s all. I admire you immensely, Miss Tuppence, more than any girl I’ve ever met. You’re so darned plucky. I’d just love to give you a real, rattling good time. Say the word, and we’ll run round right away to some high-class jeweller, and fix up the ring business.” “I can’t,” gasped Tuppence.",0
"According to the hotel porter, the train was on its good behaviour to-day and would be almost on time, though he was extremely doubtful whether it would ever get through to Johannesburg. The line had been blown up, so he solemnly assured me. It sounded cheerful! The train drew in just ten minutes late. Everybody tumbled out on the platform and began walking up and down feverishly. I had no difficulty in espying Pagett. I accosted him eagerly. He gave his usual nervous start at seeing me somewhat accentuated this time. “Dear me, Miss Beddingfeld, I understood that you had disappeared.",0
"You might be required to identify Rayburn any minute. And, besides, I have my dignity as an English Member of Parliament to think of. I can’t go about with a secretary who has apparently recently been indulging in a vulgar street-brawl.” Pagett winced. He is such a respectable fellow that his appearance is pain and tribulation to him. “But what will you do about your correspondence and the notes for your speeches, Sir Eustace?” “I shall manage,” I said airily. “Your private car is to be attached to the eleven-o’clock train to-morrow, Wednesday, morning,” Pagett continued.",0
"She had a long pale face, and wonderful dark eyes that burnt with a light almost fanatical. She looked more like a priestess of old than a modern Frenchwoman. One cheek was disfigured by a scar, and I remembered that her husband and co-worker had been killed in an explosion in the laboratory three years before, and that she herself had been terribly burned. Ever since then she had shut herself away from the world, and plunged with fiery energy into the work of scientific research. She received us with cold politeness. ""I have been interviewed by the police many times, messieurs.",0
"On Friday we’re going down to Yardly Chase to spend a few days with Lord and Lady Yardly.” Her words awoke a vague echo of remembrance in my mind. Some gossip what was it now? A few years ago Lord and Lady Yardly had paid a visit to the States, rumour had it that his lordship had rather gone the pace out there with the assistance of some lady friends but surely there was something more, some gossip which coupled Lady Yardly’s name with that of a “movie” star in California why! it came to me in a flash of course it was none other than Gregory B. Rolf. “I’ll let you into a little secret, Monsieur Poirot,” Miss Marvell was continuing.",0
"M. Renauld is planning all the circumstances of his death she has only to step in at the right moment and turn the farce into a grim reality. And here comes in the second point which led me infallibly to Marthe Daubreuil the dagger! Jack Renauld had three souvenirs made. One he gave to his mother, one to Bella Duveen; was it not highly probable that he had given the third one to Marthe Daubreuil? “So then, to sum up, there were four points of note against Marthe Daubreuil: “(1) Marthe Daubreuil could have overheard M. Renauld’s plans.",0
"Anyhow he suggested sending us up in the coal lift instead of ringing the bell. And sure enough we landed in the scullery and came right along to find you. Albert’s still below, and must be just hopping mad by this time.” With which Julius departed abruptly. “Now then, Miss Tuppence,” said Sir James, “you know this place better than I do. Where do you suggest we should take up our quarters?” Tuppence considered for a moment or two. “I think Mrs. Vandemeyer’s boudoir would be the most comfortable,” she said at last, and led the way there. Sir James looked round approvingly. “This will do very well, and now, my dear young lady, do go to bed and get some sleep.” Tuppence shook her head resolutely.",0
"But his pleasure was so evident that I put my slight annoyance aside. “Then, that’s all right,” I said hastily. Saturday evening saw us dining at the Grand Metropolitan in the midst of a gay throng. All the world and his wife seemed to be at Brighton. The dresses were marvellous, and the jewels worn sometimes with more love of display than good taste were something magnificent. “Hein, it is a sight this!” murmured Poirot. “This is the home of the Profiteer, is it not so, Hastings?” “Supposed to be,” I replied. “But we’ll hope they aren’t all tarred with the Profiteering brush.” Poirot gazed round him placidly. “The sight of so many jewels makes me wish I had turned my brains to crime, instead of to its detection.",0
"Think I want to look like a little frump up from the country?” She took one last look in the mirror, smiled approval, and put it and her vanity-box away in her bag. “That’s better. Keeping up appearances is a bit of a fag, I grant, but if a girl respects herself it’s up to her not to let herself get slack.” To this essentially moral sentiment, I had no reply. A point of view makes a great difference. I secured a couple of porters, and we alighted on the platform. My companion held out her hand. “Good-bye, and I’ll mind my language better in future.",0
"“Did M. Renauld take you into his confidence at all as to the dispositions of his will?” “I know all about it took it to the lawyer for him after he’d drawn it out. I can give you the name of his solicitors if you want to see it. They’ve got it there. Quite simple. Half in trust to his wife for her lifetime, the other half to his son. A few legacies. I rather think he left me a thousand.” “When was this will drawn up?” “Oh, about a year and a half ago.” “Would it surprise you very much, M. Stonor, to hear that M. Renauld had made another will, less than a fortnight ago?” Stonor was obviously very much surprised. “I’d no idea of it.",0
"To shoot himself in the way indicated, he would probably have had to pull the trigger with his toe or at least so I imagine. Now if Maltravers had been found with one boot off, we should almost certainly have heard of it from some one. An odd detail like that would have been remembered. “No, as I say, I inclined to the view that it was a case of murder, not suicide, but I realized that I had not a shadow of proof in support of my theory. Hence the elaborate little comedy you saw played to-night.” “Even now I don’t quite see all the details of the crime?” I said. “Let us start from the beginning.",0
And I feel an urgent need for self-expression The book will only be taken from my dead body “ From an early age I realized that I had exceptional abilities. Only a fool underestimates his capabilities. My brain power was greatly above the average. I know that I was born to succeed. My appearance was the only thing against me. I was quiet and insignificant utterly nondescript “ When I was a boy I heard a famous murder trial. I was deeply impressed by the power and eloquence of the counsel for the defence.,0
"Thenceforward, he strenuously, and quite uselessly, upheld the theory of ‘Death from natural causes’.” “And what about the ‘extra coffee-cup’?” “I was fairly certain that it was Mrs. Cavendish who had hidden it, but I had to make sure. Monsieur Lawrence did not know at all what I meant; but, on reflection, he came to the conclusion that if he could find an extra coffee-cup anywhere his lady love would be cleared of suspicion. And he was perfectly right.” “One thing more. What did Mrs.",0
"“Miss Murdoch too,” I continued, “there’s nothing untruthful about her.” “No. But it was strange that she never heard a sound, sleeping next door; whereas Mrs. Cavendish, in the other wing of the building, distinctly heard the table fall.” “Well, she’s young. And she sleeps soundly.” “Ah, yes, indeed! She must be a famous sleeper, that one!” I did not quite like the tone of his voice, but at that moment a smart knock reached our ears, and looking out of the window we perceived the two detectives waiting for us below.",0
"“Count Stepanov, or some such,” she remarked, and affecting a frank and unvarnished curiosity: “Who’s he?” “A Russian gentleman, I believe.” “Come here much?” “Once in a while. What d’you want to know for?” “Fancied he might be sweet on the missus, that’s all,” explained the girl, adding with an appearance of sulkiness: “How you do take one up!” “I’m not quite easy in my mind about the soufflé,” explained the other. “You know something,” thought Tuppence to herself, but aloud she only said: “Going to dish up now? Right-o.” Whilst waiting at table, Tuppence listened closely to all that was said.",0
"Possibly there may be something beneath it which the good Françoise overlooked.’” “Françoise?” “Or Denise, or Léonie. Whoever did this room. Since there is no dust, the room must have been done this morning. I reconstruct the incident like this. Yesterday, possibly last night, M. Renauld drew a cheque to the order of some one named Duveen. Afterwards it was torn up, and scattered on the floor. This morning ” But M. Bex was already pulling impatiently at the bell. Françoise answered it. Yes, there had been a lot of pieces of paper on the floor. What had she done with them? Put them in the kitchen stove of course! What else? With a gesture of despair, Bex dismissed her.",0
"It is undoubtedly far more their affair to kidnap him.” “But why?” “Because uncertainty creates panic. That is one reason. Were the Prime Minister dead, it would be a terrible calamity, but the situation would have to be faced. But now you have paralysis. Will the Prime Minister reappear, or will he not? Is he dead or alive? Nobody knows, and until they know nothing definite can be done. And, as I tell you, uncertainty breeds panic, which is what les Boches are playing for.",0
"By one master-stroke the blackmailed had rid himself of the blackmailer, and at the same time had provided a victim to whom the crime would be ascribed. The hand of the ‘Colonel’ was very plain. For the second time I was to be his victim. Fool that I had been to walk into the trap so easily. “I hardly know what I did next. I managed to go out of the place looking fairly normal, but I knew that it could not be long before the crime was discovered and a description of my appearance telegraphed all over the country.",0
"Again, we can find no one who saw any one enter the flat during our absence, and we have found out nothing about the movements of our late friend, Mayerling.... ""No, Hastings, Number Four has left no trace, and he knows it. His visit we may call a reconnaissance. Perhaps he wanted to make quite sure that Mayerling was dead, but more likely, I think, he came to see Hercule Poirot, and to have speech with the adversary whom alone he must fear."" Poirot's reasoning appeared to me typically egotistical, but I forbore to argue. ""And what about the inquest?"" I asked.",0
"He stayed so for a minute or two, then drew a deep breath, and pressed it ever so slightly inward. The door did not budge. Tommy was annoyed. If he had to use too much force, it would almost certainly creak. He waited until the voices rose a little, then he tried again. Still nothing happened. He increased the pressure. Had the beastly thing stuck? Finally, in desperation, he pushed with all his might. But the door remained firm, and at last the truth dawned upon him. It was locked or bolted on the inside. For a moment or two Tommy’s indignation got the better of him. “Well, I’m damned!” he said.",0
"Then a voice behind me made me start: “Excuse me, Miss Beddingfeld, but I’m just going down in a car. I can drop you and Mrs. Blair at the station.” “Oh, thank you,” I said hastily. “But there’s no need to trouble you. I” “No trouble at all, I assure you. Put the luggage in, porter.” I was helpless. I might have protested further, but a slight warning nudge from Suzanne urged me to be on my guard. “Thank you, Mr. Pagett,” I said coldly. We all got into the car. As we raced down the road into the town, I racked my brains for something to say. In the end Pagett himself broke the silence. “I have secured a very capable secretary for Sir Eustace,” he observed.",0
"“And what are you doing here, M. Stonor?” inquired Poirot. “One must stand by one’s friends,” replied the other dryly. “Especially when they are unjustly accused.” “Then you do not believe that Jack Renauld committed the crime?” I asked eagerly. “Certainly I don’t. I know the lad. I admit that there have been one or two things in this business that have staggered me completely, but none the less, in spite of his fool way of taking it, I’ll never believe that Jack Renauld is a murderer.” My heart warmed to the secretary.",0
"""But it was a glorious day!” I interrupted. “Poirot, you’re pulling my leg!” “Not at all. The thermometer registered 80 degrees in the shade. Do not forget that, my friend. It is the key to the whole riddle!” “And the second point?” I asked. “The important fact that Monsieur Inglethorp wears very peculiar clothes, has a black beard, and uses glasses.” “Poirot, I cannot believe you are serious.” “I am absolutely serious, my friend.” “But this is childish!” “No, it is very momentous.” “And supposing the Coroner’s jury returns a verdict of Wilful Murder against Alfred Inglethorp.",0
"Everard,’ at Hampstead, Daniels’ so-called ‘aunt.’ In reality, she is Frau Bertha Ebenthal, and the police have been looking for her for some time. It is a valuable little present that I have made to them to say nothing of Daniels! Ah, it was a clever plan, but he did not reckon on the cleverness of Hercule Poirot!” I think my friend might well be excused his moment of vanity.",0
"The events of the night seemed fantastic and impossible. Nobody would answer my questions. Nobody had seemed to hear them. Angrily, I flung myself into bed, and slept the sleep of the bewildered and utterly exhausted. I awoke to find the sun pouring in through the open windows and Poirot, neat and smiling, sitting beside the bed. “Enfin you wake! But it is that you are a famous sleeper, Hastings! Do you know that it is nearly eleven o’clock?” I groaned and put a hand to my head. “I must have been dreaming,” I said.",0
"As we turned in at the lodge gates, John said: “I’m afraid you’ll find it very quiet down here, Hastings.” “My dear fellow, that’s just what I want.” “Oh, it’s pleasant enough if you want to lead the idle life. I drill with the volunteers twice a week, and lend a hand at the farms. My wife works regularly ‘on the land’. She is up at five every morning to milk, and keeps at it steadily until lunchtime. It’s a jolly good life taking it all round if it weren’t for that fellow Alfred Inglethorp!” He checked the car suddenly, and glanced at his watch.",0
"Suddenly it emerged into a little clearing from which one obtained a view of the sea. A seat had been placed here, and not far from it was a rather ramshackle shed. A few steps further on, a neat line of small bushes marked the boundary of the Villa grounds. M. Bex pushed his way through these and we found ourselves on a wide stretch of open downs. I looked round, and saw something that filled me with astonishment. “Why, this is a golf course,” I cried. Bex nodded. “The limits are not completed yet,” he explained.",0
"Too late, Tommy remembered his scheme of obliterating the unprepossessing Conrad. A moment later he was glad that he had, for it was not Conrad who entered, but a girl. She carried a tray which she set down on the table. In the feeble light of the gas burner Tommy blinked at her. He decided at once that she was one of the most beautiful girls he had ever seen. Her hair was a full rich brown, with sudden glints of gold in it as though there were imprisoned sunbeams struggling in its depths. There was a wild-rose quality about her face.",0
"The draft treaty was Tommy’s bait. Every now and then he was aghast at his own presumption. How dared he think that he had discovered what so many wiser and clever men had overlooked? Nevertheless, he stuck tenaciously to his idea. That evening he and Albert once more penetrated the grounds of Astley Priors. Tommy’s ambition was somehow or other to gain admission to the house itself. As they approached cautiously, Tommy gave a sudden gasp. On the second floor window some one standing between the window and the light in the room threw a silhouette on the blind.",0
"If he liked to leave it to me, well and good, but I gave him detailed instructions how to reach the quarry from the station in case he should deem it wise to be present himself. I took the letter down to the village and posted it myself. I had been able to communicate with Poirot throughout my stay, by the simple expedient of posting my letters myself, but we had agreed that he should not attempt to communicate with me in case my letters should be tampered with. I was in a glow of excitement the following evening.",0
"“Not even Hercule Poirot,” said my friend, with a smile. “I am about to inquire now. I had to prove my point to you first. But you will see, I shall be right; and then Japp, to whom I have already given a hint, will be able to arrest the respectable Graves. I wonder how much of the money he has spent.” Poirot was right. He always is, confound him! The problem presented to us by Miss Violet Marsh made rather a pleasant change from our usual routine work. Poirot had received a brisk and business-like note from the lady asking for an appointment, and he had replied asking her to call upon him at eleven o’clock the following day.",0
"Mrs. Inglethorp.’ No, I see nothing unusual.” “Not the fact that there is no chemist’s name?” “Ah!” I exclaimed. “To be sure, that is odd!” “Have you ever known a chemist to send out a box like that, without his printed name?” “No, I can’t say that I have.” I was becoming quite excited, but Poirot damped my ardour by remarking: “Yet the explanation is quite simple. So do not intrigue yourself, my friend.” An audible creaking proclaimed the approach of Annie, so I had no time to reply. Annie was a fine, strapping girl, and was evidently labouring under intense excitement, mingled with a certain ghoulish enjoyment of the tragedy.",0
"” Poirot raised his eyebrows. “Ça commence!” he murmured. “Already you have seen a goddess!” “But, hang it all, wasn’t she?” “Possibly. I did not remark the fact.” “Surely you noticed her?” “Mon ami, two people rarely see the same thing. You, for instance, saw a goddess. I ” he hesitated. “Yes?” “I saw only a girl with anxious eyes,” said Poirot gravely. But at that moment we drew up at a big green gate, and, simultaneously, we both uttered an exclamation. Before it stood an imposing sergent de ville. He held up his hand to bar our way. “You cannot pass, monsieurs.",0
"""What's that?"" I cried. ""Ma foi!"" retorted Poirot. ""It sounds very like your 'unexpected guest' in my bedroom."" ""But how can any one be in there? There's no door except into this room."" ""Your memory is excellent, Hastings. Now for the deductions."" ""The window! But it's a burglar then? He must have had a stiff climb of it I should say it was almost impossible."" I had risen to my feet and was striding in the direction of the door when the sound of a fumbling at the handle from the other side arrested me. The door swung slowly open. Framed in the doorway stood a man.",0
"It was just on eleven, and at eleven the mail train left for Rhodesia bearing with it the influential friends who might otherwise come to my rescue. That was the reason of my immunity up to now. From last night till eleven this morning I had been safe, but now the net was closing in upon me. I hurriedly opened my bag and paid for my drinks, and as I did so, my heart seemed to stand still, for inside it was a man’s wallet stuffed with notes! It must have been deftly introduced into my handbag as I left the tram. Promptly I lost my head. I hurried out of Cartwright’s.",0
"""Naturally,” said Sir James dryly. “And not a clue left behind.” “I wonder ” The lawyer tapped the table thoughtfully. Something in his voice made Tommy look up. Would this man’s eyes have seen something where theirs had been blind? He spoke impulsively: “I wish you’d been there, sir, to go over the house!” “I wish I had,” said Sir James quietly. He sat for a moment in silence. Then he looked up. “And since then? What have you been doing?” For a moment, Tommy stared at him. Then it dawned on him that of course the lawyer did not know. “I forgot that you didn’t know about Tuppence,” he said slowly.",0
"True, there was a small race-meeting at Entfield, five miles away, and if he had walked to that station he might have passed unnoticed in the crowd. But since then his photograph and a full description of him have been circulated in every newspaper, and nobody has been able to give any news of him. We have, of course, received many letters from all over England, but each clue, so far, has ended in disappointment. “On Monday morning a further sensational discovery came to light. Behind a portière in Mr. Davenheim’s study stands a safe, and that safe had been broken into and rifled.",0
"""He does nothing. He is, as I tell, of a singularly indolent disposition. But his abilities are hardly less than my own which is saying a great deal."" ""Is he like you to look at?"" ""Not unlike. But not nearly so handsome. And he wears no moustaches."" ""Is he older than you, or younger?"" ""He happens to have been born on the same day."" ""A twin,"" I cried. ""Exactly, Hastings. You jump to the right conclusion with unfailing accuracy. But here we are at home again. Let us at once get to work on that little affair of the Duchess's necklace."" But the Duchess's necklace was doomed to wait awhile.",0
"I am now at the crux of my experiments. I possess a small portion of radium myself more has been lent to me for the process I am at work upon. Small though the actual quantity is, it comprises a large amount of the world's stock and represents a value of millions of francs."" ""And where is it?"" ""In its leaden case in the big safe the safe purposely appears to be of an old and worn-out pattern, but it is really a triumph of the safe-maker's art. That is probably why the thieves were unable to open it.",0
"“I didn’t want to disappoint you, old thing, by telling you right off. It’s too bad. Good money wasted.” He sighed. “Still, there it is. The advertisement has appeared, and there are only two answers!” “Tommy, you devil!” almost screamed Tuppence. “Give them to me. How could you be so mean!” “Your language, Tuppence, your language! They’re very particular at the National Gallery. Government show, you know. And do remember, as I have pointed out to you before, that as a clergyman’s daughter ” “I ought to be on the stage!” finished Tuppence with a snap.",0
"“But some one must have admitted them? We cannot allow that, by an unparalleled piece of good fortune, they found the door ajar for them to walk in?” “D’accord, M. le juge. The door was opened for them, but it could just as easily be opened from outside by some one who possessed a key.” “But who did possess a key?” Giraud shrugged his shoulders. “As for that, no one who possesses one is going to admit the fact if they can help it. But several people might have had one. M. Jack Renauld, the son, for instance.",0
""" I pricked up my ears; so did Poirot. ""There's been no robbery, I mean,"" explained Japp. ""But the old boy was writing a book of some sort. We only knew about it this morning when there was a letter from the publishers asking about the manuscript. It was just completed, it seems. Young Paynter and I have searched high and low, but can't find a trace of it he must have hidden it away somewhere."" Poirot's eyes were shining with the green light I knew so well. ""How was it called, this book?"" he asked. ""The Hidden Hand in China, I think it was called."" ""Aha!"" said Poirot, with almost a gasp.",0
"“Oh, not really queer, Captain Hastings, but when we went to the agents, Stosser and Paul we hadn’t tried them before because they only have the expensive Mayfair flats, but we thought at any rate it would do no harm everything they offered us was four and five hundred a year, or else huge premiums, and then, just as we were going, they mentioned that they had a flat at eighty, but that they doubted if it would be any good our going there, because it had been on their books some time and they had sent so many people to see it that it was almost sure to be taken ‘snapped up’ as the clerk put it only people were so tiresome in not letting them know, and then they went on sending, and people get annoyed at being sent to a place that had, perhaps, been let some time.",0
"“Now will you believe I’m in earnest? Get out, both of you, and do as I say or I’ll shoot!” Tuppence sprang out, dragging the unwilling Jane after her. “Come on, it’s all right. If Tommy’s sure he’s sure. Be quick. We’ll miss the train.” They started running. Julius’s pent-up rage burst forth. “What the hell ” Tommy interrupted him. “Dry up! I want a few words with you, Mr. Julius Hersheimmer.” HER arm through Jane’s, dragging her along, Tuppence reached the station. Her quick ears caught the sound of the approaching train. “Hurry up,” she panted, “or we’ll miss it.",0
"""And you believe that too?” “No,” said Poirot with a curious smile. “For I know it to be the hair of a woman and more, which woman!” “Madame Daubreuil,” I announced positively. “Perhaps,” said Poirot, regarding me quizzically. But I refused to allow myself to get annoyed. “What are we going to do now?” I asked, as we entered the hall of the Villa Geneviève. “I wish to make a search amongst the effects of M. Jack Renauld. That is why I had to get him out of the way for a few hours.” “But will not Giraud have searched already?” I asked doubtfully. “Of course.",0
"But first we must have a little information. Ring the bell, I pray of you.” I did so. While we were waiting for it to be answered, Poirot walked up and down, looking about him approvingly. “A man of method this Mr. Marsh. See how neatly the packets of papers are docketed; then the key to each drawer has its ivory label so has the key of the china cabinet on the wall; and see with what precision the china within is arranged. It rejoices the heart. Nothing here offends the eye” He came to an abrupt pause, as his eye was caught by the key of the desk itself, to which a dirty envelope was affixed.",0
” Tommy came forward eagerly. “You must know something about her?” But the girl turned away abruptly. “I know nothing only the name.” She walked towards the door. Suddenly she uttered a cry. Tommy stared. She had caught sight of the picture he had laid against the wall the night before. For a moment he caught a look of terror in her eyes. As inexplicably it changed to relief. Then abruptly she went out of the room. Tommy could make nothing of it. Did she fancy that he had meant to attack her with it? Surely not. He rehung the picture on the wall thoughtfully.,0
"How often have I not heard a perfectly intelligent female say, in the tone of one clinching an argument, “Edgar says” And all the time you are perfectly aware that Edgar is a perfect fool. Suzanne, by reason of her married state, was yearning to lean upon some man or other. However, she promised faithfully that she would not breathe a word to Colonel Race, and we went on with our plan-making. “It’s quite clear that I must stay here and watch Pagett, and this is the best way to do it. I must pretend to leave for Durban this evening, take my luggage down and so on, but really I shall go to some small hotel in the town.",0
"""That's why I suspected it might have been a plant on the part of the Big Four."" ""Your reasoning is at fault, Hastings. Employ the little gray cells. If your enemies wished to deceive you they would assuredly have seen to it that the Chinaman spoke in intelligible pigeon English. No, the message was genuine. Tell me again all that you heard?"" ""First of all he made a reference to Handel's Largo, and then he said something that sounded like 'carrozzo' that's a carriage, isn't it?"" ""Nothing else?"" ""Well, just at the end he murmured something like 'Cara' somebody or other some woman's name.",0
"Listen, my friend, to-morrow I go to London.” “But your contract here?” “I shall be away only one night. And I go incognito, like Royalty. No one will ever know that I have left France. And why do you think that I go?” “Hardly for pleasure at this time of year. January, a detestable foggy month! It must be for profit, eh?” “Exactly.” She rose and stood in front of him, every graceful line of her arrogant with pride. “You said just now that none of us had anything on the chief. You were wrong. I have. I, a woman, have had the wit and, yes, the courage for it needs courage to double-cross him.",0
"” To which Mary Cavendish replied, with a rising bitterness: “Of course, I might have known you would shield him.” Cynthia was waiting for me, and greeted me eagerly with: “I say! There’s been the most awful row! I’ve got it all out of Dorcas.” “What kind of a row?” “Between Aunt Emily and him. I do hope she’s found him out at last!” “Was Dorcas there, then?” “Of course not. She ‘happened to be near the door’. It was a real old bust-up. I do wish I knew what it was all about.” I thought of Mrs.",0
"""Hm,” said Tommy doubtfully. “Well, anyway, what are we going to do? Whittington was in a hurry to get rid of you this morning, but next time he’ll want to know something more before he parts with his money. He’ll want to know how much you know, and where you got your information from, and a lot of other things that you can’t cope with. What are you going to do about it?” Tuppence frowned severely. “We must think. Order some Turkish coffee, Tommy. Stimulating to the brain.",0
"I could not help rejoicing that, for once, one of his “little ideas” had come to naught. After lunch Poirot begged me to accompany him home. I consented rather stiffly. “You are annoyed, is it not so?” he asked anxiously, as we walked through the park. “Not at all,” I said coldly. “That is well. That lifts a great load from my mind.” This was not quite what I had intended. I had hoped that he would have observed the stiffness of my manner. Still, the fervour of his words went towards the appeasing of my just displeasure. I thawed. “I gave Lawrence your message,” I said.",0
"Japp had already been prying about in the cellars, and had discovered the secret of the entrance to the subterranean chamber where I had spent such an unpleasant half-hour. Closer investigation confirmed the impression that it had made on me the night before. The silks on the walls and divan and the carpets on the floors were of exquisite workmanship. Although I know very little about Chinese art, I could appreciate that every article in the room was perfect of its kind. With the aid of Japp and some of his men we conducted a most thorough search of the apartment.",0
"Whilst admitting the truth of Julius’s objections, she had nevertheless not entirely relinquished the idea of appealing to Sir James Peel Edgerton. Indeed, she had gone so far as to look up his address in the Red Book. Had he meant to warn her that day? If so, why? Surely she was at least entitled to demand an explanation. He had looked at her so kindly. Perhaps he might tell them something concerning Mrs. Vandemeyer which might lead to a clue to Tommy’s whereabouts.",0
"But, my dear Anne, the diamonds have been in my possession ever since I left the Falls though I only discovered the fact yesterday.” “You know!” I gasped. “It may interest you to hear that it was Pagett who gave the show away. He insisted on boring me with a long pointless story about a wager and a tin of films. It didn’t take me long to put two and two together Mrs. Blair’s distrust of Colonel Race, her agitation, her entreaty that I would take care of her souvenirs for her. The excellent Pagett had already unfastened the cases through an excess of zeal. Before leaving the hotel, I simply transferred all the rolls of films to my own pocket. They are in the corner there.",0
"He ate what was put before him in an exemplary fashion, but seemed mildly pained when the question of paying for it arose. We never seemed to have any money. His celebrity was not of the kind that brought in a cash return. Although he was a fellow of almost every important society, and had rows of letters after his name, the general public scarcely knew of his existence, and his long learned books, though adding signally to the sum-total of human knowledge, had no attraction for the masses. Only on one occasion did he leap into the public gaze. He had read a paper before some society on the subject of the young of the chimpanzee.",0
"Now I wonder if I can see Mrs. Havering?” “She’s upstairs, sir. Shall I tell her?” “If you please. Tell her that Mr. Havering is outside with Inspector Japp, and that the gentleman he has brought back with him from London is anxious to speak to her as soon as possible.” “Very good, sir.” I was in a fever of impatience to get at all the facts. Japp had two or three hours’ start of me, and his anxiety to be gone made me keen to be close at his heels. Mrs. Havering did not keep me waiting long. In a few minutes I heard a light step descending the stairs, and looked up to see a very handsome young woman coming towards me. She wore a flame-coloured jumper, that set off the slender boyishness of her figure.",0
"“Order” and “Method” were his gods. He had a certain disdain for tangible evidence, such as footprints and cigarette ash, and would maintain that, taken by themselves, they would never enable a detective to solve a problem. Then he would tap his egg-shaped head with absurd complacency, and remark with great satisfaction: “The true work, it is done from within.",0
"Then, his face lightening, he ran to the desk. In a minute he was hunting through the dead man’s cheque book. Then he repeated his former gesture. The last counterfoil was blank. “Courage!” cried Poirot, clapping him on the back. “Without doubt, Madame Renauld will be able to tell us all about this mysterious person named Duveen.” The commissary’s face cleared. “That is true. Let us proceed.” As we turned to leave the room, Poirot remarked casually: “It was here that M. Renauld received his guest last night, eh?” “It was but how did you know?” “By this. I found it on the back of the leather chair.",0
"“Perhaps,” she said; and then swiftly passed out of the little glade, leaving John standing there as though he had been turned to stone. Rather ostentatiously, I stepped forward, crackling some dead branches with my feet as I did so. John turned. Luckily, he took it for granted that I had only just come upon the scene. “Hullo, Hastings. Have you seen the little fellow safely back to his cottage? Quaint little chap! Is he any good, though, really?” “He was considered one of the finest detectives of his day.” “Oh, well, I suppose there must be something in it, then. What a rotten world it is, though!” “You find it so?” I asked.",0
"Personally, I did not notice a laurel bush of any kind, so deduced that it had been named according to the usual obscure nomenclature of the suburbs. We were admitted by an impassive-faced Chinese servant and ushered into the presence of his master. Mr. Ingles was a squarely-built man, somewhat yellow of countenance, with deep-set eyes that were oddly reflective in character. He rose to greet us, setting aside an open letter which he had held in his hand. He referred to it after his greeting.",0
"""Is there anything wrong with the ship?"" ""I expect you know what's the matter better than I do,"" he replied dryly. ""Special instructions from the Admiralty. There's a destroyer waiting to take you off."" ""What?"" I cried. ""In mid-ocean?"" ""It seems a most mysterious affair, but that's not my business. They've sent a young fellow aboard who is to take your place, and we are all sworn to secrecy. Will you get up and dress?"" Utterly unable to conceal my amazement I did as I was told. A boat was lowered, and I was conveyed aboard the destroyer.",0
"There’s a sort of deft professional callousness that this man hadn’t got. Besides, a doctor doesn’t usually feel for the heart on the right side of the body.” “He did that?” “Yes, I didn’t notice it specially at the time except that I felt there was something wrong. But I worked it out when I got home, and then I saw why the whole thing had looked so unhandy to me at the time.” “H’m,” said the inspector. He was reaching slowly for pen and paper. “In running his hands over the upper part of the man’s body he would have ample opportunity to take anything he wanted from the pockets.” “Doesn’t sound likely to me,” said the inspector.",0
"“He rang me up,” he volunteered. “Would you have any objection to telling us exactly what passed between you?” “Not at all. He thanked me for a certain letter which I had written to him as a matter of fact, I had offered him a job. Then he reminded me of something I had said to him at Manchester respecting that bogus telegram which lured Miss Cowley away. I asked him if anything untoward had occurred. He said it had that in a drawer in Mr. Hersheimmer’s room he had discovered a photograph.",0
"But in any case, however lenient the sentence of the Court, it must mean a long term of imprisonment. No, Bella must be protected. And, at the same time, Jack Renauld must be saved. How this was to be accomplished I did not see clearly. But I pinned my faith to Poirot. He knew. Come what might, he would manage to save an innocent man. He must find some pretext other than the real one. It might be difficult, but he would manage it somehow. And with Bella unsuspected, and Jack Renauld acquitted, all would end satisfactorily.",0
"“Miss Beddingfeld got the cabin, but this morning I saw Chichester coming out of it in a furtive sort of way.” I looked at him severely. “If you’re trying to get up a nasty scandal about Chichester, who is a missionary though a perfectly poisonous person and that attractive child, Anne Beddingfeld, I don’t believe a word of it,” I said coldly. “Anne Beddingfeld is an extremely nice girl with particularly good legs. I should say she had far and away the best legs on board.” Pagett did not like my reference to Anne Beddingfeld’s legs.",0
"Tosswill, “I will take you to Sir Guy Willard. He was most anxious to be informed as soon as you should arrive.” We were taken across the camp to a large tent. Dr. Tosswill lifted up the flap and we entered. Three men were sitting inside. “Monsieur Poirot and Captain Hastings have arrived, Sir Guy,” said Tosswill. The youngest of the three men jumped up and came forward to greet us. There was a certain impulsiveness in his manner which reminded me of his mother.",0
"“I call it a theory but I’m pretty sure of my facts facts that are known to no one but myself. In any case what do you lose? If I can produce the papers you give me my life and liberty in exchange. Is it a bargain?” “And if we refuse?” said the German quietly. Tommy lay back on the couch. “The 29th,” he said thoughtfully, “is less than a fortnight ahead ” For a moment the German hesitated. Then he made a sign to Conrad. “Take him into the other room.” For five minutes, Tommy sat on the bed in the dingy room next door. His heart was beating violently. He had risked all on this throw.",0
"A man took refuge in my rooms. He was suffering badly from shock, but he managed to tell us enough to interest us in this Li Chang Yen. He described four people the Big Four an organisation hitherto undreamed of. Number One is Li Chang Yen, Number Two is an unknown American, Number Three an equally unknown Frenchwoman, Number Four may be called the executive of the organisation the destroyer. My informant died. Tell me, monsieur, is that phrase known to you at all? The Big Four."" ""Not in connection with Li Chang Yen. No, I can't say it is. But I've heard it, or read it, just lately and in some unusual connection too.",0
"""How on earth did you manage to convince her? It was a pretty thin story to make her swallow all that about a dead child."" ""The countess has a great deal more perspicacity than you have, my dear Hastings. She was taken in at first by my disguise; but she soon saw through it. When she said, 'You are very clever, M. Achille Poirot,' I knew that she had guessed the truth. It was then or never to play my trump card."" ""All that rigmarole about bringing the dead to life?"" ""Exactly but then, you see, I had the child all along."" ""What?"" ""But yes! You know my motto Be prepared.",0
"Ah, I've got it."" He rose and went across to an inlaid lacquer cabinet an exquisite thing, as even I could see. He returned with a letter in his hand. ""Here you are. Note from an old sea-faring man I ran against once in Shanghai. Hoary old reprobate maudlin with drink by now, I should say. I took this to be the ravings of alcoholism."" He read it aloud: ""DEAR SIR, You may not remember me, but you did me a good turn once in Shanghai. Do me another now. I must have money to get out of the country.",0
"Only” “Yes?” “Eh bien, afterwards he had to wear a false beard and wig, had to make up as himself again, and to sleep with a false beard is not easy it invites detection! He cannot risk continuing to share the chamber of madame his wife. You found out for me that for the last six months, or ever since his supposed return from Buenos Ayres, he and Mrs. Davenheim occupied separate rooms. Then I was sure! Everything fitted in. The gardener who fancied he saw his master going round to the side of the house was quite right.",0
"Presently, when the offending waiter was serving us with soup, Poirot spoke to him. ""An unfortunate accident, that. But it was not your fault."" ""Monsieur saw that? No, indeed it was not my fault. The gentleman half sprung up from his chair I thought he was going to have an attack of some kind. I could not save the catastrophe."" I saw Poirot's eyes shining with the green light I knew so well, and as the waiter departed he said to me in a low voice: ""You see, Hastings, the effect of Hercule Poirot alive and in the flesh?"" ""You think "" I had not time to continue.",0
"There is nothing that can compromise him in any way, since it is Miss Howard who has the strychnine, which, after all, is only wanted as a blind to throw suspicion on John Cavendish. “But now a hitch occurs. Mrs. Inglethorp does not take her medicine that night. The broken bell, Cynthia’s absence arranged by Inglethorp through his wife all these are wasted. And then he makes his slip. “Mrs. Inglethorp is out, and he sits down to write to his accomplice, who, he fears, may be in a panic at the non-success of their plan. It is probable that Mrs. Inglethorp returned earlier than he expected.",0
"The black silk handbag which she carried contained a well-filled notecase and some loose change, a fine lace handkerchief, unmarked, and the return half of a first-class ticket to London. Nothing much there to go upon. Such were the details published broadcast by the Daily Budget, and “Find the Man in the Brown Suit” was their daily war-cry. On an average about five hundred people wrote daily to announce their success in the quest, and tall young men with well-tanned faces cursed the day when their tailors had persuaded them to a brown suit.",0
"“I have been visiting an old woman in the village,” she explained, “and as Lawrence told me you were with Monsieur Poirot I thought I would call for you.” “Alas, madame,” said Poirot, “I thought you had come to honour me with a visit!” “I will some day, if you ask me,” she promised him, smiling. “That is well. If you should need a father confessor, madame” she started ever so slightly “remember, Papa Poirot is always at your service.” She stared at him for a few minutes, as though seeking to read some deeper meaning into his words. Then she turned abruptly away.",0
"” Time went on, and the mysterious bearded men were never traced. And then, just as public interest was beginning to die down, a startling development occurred. Madame Beroldy was arrested and charged with the murder of her husband. The trial, when it came on, aroused widespread interest. The youth and beauty of the accused, and her mysterious history, were sufficient to make of it a cause célèbre. People ranged themselves wildly for or against the prisoner. But her partisans received several severe checks to their enthusiasm.",0
"He was a marvellous little fellow. He used to say that all good detective work was a mere matter of method. My system is based on his though of course I have progressed rather further. He was a funny little man, a great dandy, but wonderfully clever.” “Like a good detective story myself,” remarked Miss Howard. “Lots of nonsense written, though. Criminal discovered in last “There have been a great number of undiscovered crimes,” I argued. “Don’t mean the police, but the people that are right in it. The family. You couldn’t really hoodwink them. They’d know.",0
"I’m looking forward to leaving him behind in Cape Town.” “He is staying behind?” “Yes, he’ll enjoy himself thoroughly sleuthing about after Rayburn. That’s the sort of thing suits Pagett down to the ground. He adores intrigue. But I’m quite serious in my offer. Will you come? Mrs. Blair here is a competent chaperon, and you can have a half-holiday every now and again to dig for bones.” “Thank you very much, Sir Eustace,” I said cautiously, “but I think I’m leaving for Durban to-night.” “Now don’t be an obstinate girl. Remember, there are lots of lions in Rhodesia. You’ll like lions.",0
"""And Carton?” “No. He saw us both with Nadina at Kimberley one night, but he didn’t know which was which. He accepted my statement that I was Lucas, and Nadina was deceived by his cable. She was never afraid of Lucas. He was a quiet chap very deep. But I always had the devil’s own temper. She’d have been scared out of her life if she’d known that I’d come to life again.” “Harry, if Colonel Race hadn’t told me, what did you mean to do?” “Say nothing. Go on as Lucas.” “And your father’s millions?” “Race was welcome to them. Anyway, he would make a better use of them than I ever shall.",0
"How was it that no one had seen him?"" The Inspector paused with a flourish. ""Aha, I perceive your point,"" said Poirot. ""To continue?"" ""Well, sir, fishy, I said to myself fishy. And I began to look about me. Those jade figures, now. Would a common tramp ever suspect that they were valuable? Anyway, it was madness to try such a thing in broad daylight. Suppose the old man had yelled for help?"" ""I suppose, Inspector,"" said Mr. Ingles, ""that the bruise on the head was inflicted before death?"" ""Quite right, sir. First knocked him silly, the murderer did, and then cut his throat. That's clear enough.",0
"“There’s no time to lose,” said Tuppence, crossing the road. “I’ve got to stop her. At all costs I must keep her here until ” She broke off. “Albert, there’s a telephone here, isn’t there?” The boy shook his head. “The flats mostly have their own, miss. But there’s a box just round the corner.” “Go to it then, at once, and ring up the Ritz Hotel. Ask for Mr. Hersheimmer, and when you get him tell him to get Sir James and come on at once, as Mrs. Vandemeyer is trying to hook it. If you can’t get him, ring up Sir James Peel Edgerton, you’ll find his number in the book, and tell him what’s happening.",0
"""What is that?” “Jack Renauld was presumably acquainted with the planning out of the golf course. He knew that the body would be discovered almost at once, when they started to dig the bunker.” Giraud laughed out loud. “But it is idiotic what you say there! He wanted the body to be found! Until it was found, he could not presume death, and would have been unable to enter into his inheritance.” I saw a quick flash of green in Poirot’s eyes as he rose to his feet. “Then why bury it?” he asked softly. “Reflect, Giraud.",0
"Ingles was a man mounted on his hobby horse, and evidently he, too, realised that he had been carried away, for he laughed apologetically. ""But, of course,"" he said, ""I have no proofs, and you, like the others, will merely tell me that I have a bee in my bonnet."" ""On the contrary,"" said Poirot quietly, ""we have every reason to believe your story. We ourselves are more than a little interested in Li Chang Yen."" ""Very odd your knowing about him. Didn't fancy a soul in England had ever heard of him. I'd rather like to know how you did come to hear of him if it's not indiscreet."" ""Not in the least, monsieur.",0
"“Mr. Brown’s methods are not so crude. In the meantime we must send for a doctor, but before we do so, is there anything in this room that might be of value to us?” Hastily, the three searched. A charred mass in the grate indicated that Mrs. Vandemeyer had been burning papers on the eve of her flight. Nothing of importance remained, though they searched the other rooms as well. “There’s that,” said Tuppence suddenly, pointing to a small, old-fashioned safe let into the wall. “It’s for jewellery, I believe, but there might be something else in it.” The key was in the lock, and Julius swung open the door, and searched inside. He was some time over the task.",0
"""When was that?” “About half-past twelve, sir.” “Tell me exactly what happened.” The small boy drew a long breath. “I took up a telegram to No. 891 the lady was there. She opened it and gave a gasp, and then she said, very jolly like: ‘Bring me up a Bradshaw, and an A.B.C., and look sharp, Henry.’ My name isn’t Henry, but ” “Never mind your name,” said Tommy impatiently. “Go on.” “Yes, sir. I brought them, and she told me to wait, and looked up something. And then she looks up at the clock, and ‘Hurry up,’ she says.",0
"He came here, he had his interview, he left. What happened next?"" Seizing me by the arm, Poirot was fairly dragging me back to the villa. ""Now, mon ami, imagine that it is the day after the disappearance, and that we are tracking footprints. You love footprints, do you not? See here they go, a man's, Mr. Halliday's....

"The Daily Budget was hard up for a sensation. My guess was verified and proved to be correct and the Daily Budget had the scoop of its lifetime. “Victim of the Mill House Murder identified by our special reporter.” And so on. “Our reporter makes voyage with the murderer. ‘The Man in the Brown Suit.’ What he is really like.” The main facts were, of course, cabled to the South African papers, but I only read my own lengthy articles at a much later date! I received approval and full instructions by cable at Bulawayo.",0
"Vandemeyer was on the eve of departure for abroad, and that the servants had already left? Sir James and his young friends had been paying a call upon her, when she was suddenly stricken down and they had spent the night in the flat, not liking to leave her alone. Did they know of any relatives? They did not, but Sir James referred him to Mrs. Vandemeyer’s solicitor. Shortly afterwards a nurse arrived to take charge, and the other left the ill-omened building. “And what now?” asked Julius, with a gesture of despair. “I guess we’re down and out for good.” Sir James stroked his chin thoughtfully.",0
""" Poirot stood as though stunned. The nurse, mistaking his emotion, began speaking gently. ""She did not suffer, and she was unconscious towards the last. She was run over by a motor, you know and the driver of the car did not even stop. Wicked, isn't it? I hope some one took the number."" ""The stars fight against us,"" said Poirot, in a low voice. ""You would like to see her?"" The nurse led the way, and we followed. Poor Flossie Monro, with her rouge and her dyed hair. She lay there very peacefully, with a little smile on her lips. ""Yes,"" murmured Poirot.",0
"It ran as follows: “The great diamond which is the left eye of the god must return whence it came.” The second letter was couched in precisely the same terms, but the third was more explicit: “You have been warned. You have not obeyed. Now the diamond will be taken from you. At the full of the moon, the two diamonds which are the left and right eye of the god shall return. So it is written.” “The first letter I treated as a joke,” explained Miss Marvell. “When I got the second, I began to wonder. The third one came yesterday, and it seemed to me that, after all, the matter might be more serious than I had imagined.",0
"There was blood on his lips, and he held his right hand out, pointing. Suddenly a brilliant light seemed to proceed from it. It passed over Poirot and me, and fell on Mrs. Maltravers. I saw her white terrified face, and something else! “My God, Poirot!” I cried. “Look at her hand, her right hand. It’s all red!” Her own eyes fell on it, and she collapsed in a heap on the floor. “Blood,” she cried hysterically. “Yes, it’s blood. I killed him. I did it. He was showing me, and then I put my hand on the trigger and pressed. Save me from him save me! he’s come back!” Her voice died away in a gurgle. “Lights,” said Poirot briskly. The lights went on as if by magic.",0
"This last-comer came up the stairs so quietly that he was almost abreast of Tommy before the young man had realized his presence. He was a small man, very pale, with a gentle almost womanish air. The angle of the cheek-bones hinted at his Slavonic ancestry, otherwise there was nothing to indicate his nationality. As he passed the recess, he turned his head slowly. The strange light eyes seemed to burn through the curtain; Tommy could hardly believe that the man did not know he was there and in spite of himself he shivered.",0
"""One of the hotel staff, perhaps?"" ""Only a waiter carrying a tray, monsieur."" ""Ah!"" said Poirot, in a tone that spoke infinities. ""So that was why he wore his overcoat buttoned up to his chin,"" mused Poirot, when we had finally got rid of the excited hotel officials. ""I'm awfully sorry, Poirot,"" I murmured, rather crestfallen. ""I thought I'd downed him all right."" ""Yes, that was a Japanese trick, I fancy. Do not distress yourself, mon ami. All went according to plan his plan. That is what I wanted."" ""What's this?"" I cried, pouncing on a brown object that lay on the floor.",0
"Blair hailed me as I came on deck. “Good-morning, Gipsy girl, sit down here by me. You look as though you hadn’t slept well.” “Why do you call me that?” I asked, as I sat down obediently. “Do you mind? It suits you somehow. I’ve called you that in my own mind from the beginning. It’s the gipsy element in you that makes you so different from any one else. I decided in my own mind that you and Colonel Race were the only two people on board who wouldn’t bore me to death to talk to.” “That’s funny,” I said, “I thought the same about you only it’s more understandable in your case. You’re you’re such an exquisitely finished product.",0
"“Épatant!” murmured Poirot. “Without doubt a romance of the first water.” He turned to Mary Marvell. “And you are not afraid, madame? You have no superstitious terrors? You do not fear to introduce these two Siamese twins to each other lest a Chinaman should appear and, hey presto! whisk them both back to China?” His tone was mocking, but I fancied that an undercurrent of seriousness lay beneath it. “I don’t believe that Lady Yardly’s diamond is anything like as good a stone as mine,” said Miss Marvell. “Anyway, I’m going to see.",0
"He had entered the squalid room to find that great man, the friend of a lifetime, dead betrayed out of his own mouth. From the dead man’s pocket-book he had retrieved the ill-omened draft treaty, and then and there, in the presence of the other three, it had been reduced to ashes England was saved! And now, on the evening of the 30th, in a private room at the Savoy, Mr. Julius P. Hersheimmer was receiving his guests. Mr. Carter was the first to arrive. With him was a choleric-looking old gentleman, at sight of whom Tommy flushed up to the roots of his hair. He came forward.",0
"There was a wallet with some notes in it and one or two unimportant letters, there was a roll of films which I must have dropped somewhere later and there was a piece of paper with an appointment made on it for the 22nd on the Kilmorden Castle. In my haste to get away before any one detained me, I dropped that also, but fortunately I remembered the figures. “I hurried to the nearest cloak-room and hastily removed my make-up. I did not want to be laid by the heels for picking a dead man’s pocket. Then I retraced my steps to the Hyde Park Hotel. Nadina was still having lunch. I needn’t describe in detail how I followed her down to Marlow.",0
"Il l’a emportée simplement! Naturally when she reached England she was prostrate, but she still breathed.” Poirot shook his head seriously. I composed my face as best I could. Suddenly he stiffened and pointed a dramatic finger at the toast rack. “Ah, par exemple, c’est trop fort!” he cried. “What is it?” “This piece of toast. You remark him not?” He whipped the offender out of the rack, and held it up for me to examine. “Is it square? No. Is it a triangle? Again no. Is it even round? No. Is it of any shape remotely pleasing to the eye? What symmetry have we here? None.” “It’s cut from a cottage loaf,” I explained soothingly.",0
"Beresford is commissioned by the British Government to get those papers back. Sir James Peel Edgerton is an English Member of Parliament, and might be a big gun in the Cabinet if he liked. It’s owing to him that we’ve ferreted you out at last. So you can go right ahead and tell us the whole story. Did Danvers give you the papers?” “Yes. He said they’d have a better chance with me, because they would save the women and children first.” “Just as we thought,” said Sir James. “He said they were very important that they might make all the difference to the Allies.",0
"""Could your conversation be overheard by them or any one else?"" Madame reflected, then shook her head. ""I do not think so. I am almost sure it could not. The doors were all shut."" ""Could any one have been concealed in the room?"" ""There is the big cupboard in the corner but the idea is absurd."" ""Pas tout à fait, madame. One thing more: did M. Halliday make any mention of his plans for the evening?"" ""He said nothing whatever, monsieur."" ""I thank you, madame, and I apologise for disturbing you. Pray do not trouble we can find our way out."" We stepped out into the hall.",0
"I thank you. My friend Hastings will have the kindness to say ‘Go!’” “Go!” I said. With almost incredible swiftness, Poirot wrenched open the drawer of the dressing-table, extracted the jewel-case, fitted the key in the lock, opened the case, selected a piece of jewellery, shut and locked the case, and returned it to the drawer, which he pushed to again. His movements were like lightning. “Well, mon ami?” he demanded of me breathlessly. “Forty-six seconds,” I replied. “You see?” He looked round. “There would not have been time for the chambermaid even to take the necklace out, far less hide it.",0
"I must say I was surprised the jury didn’t bring it in Wilful Murder against him right off. I think they would have, if it hadn’t been for the Coroner he seemed to be holding them back.” “Perhaps, though, you have a warrant for his arrest in your pocket now,” suggested Poirot. A kind of wooden shutter of officialdom came down from Japp’s expressive countenance. “Perhaps I have, and perhaps I haven’t,” he remarked dryly. Poirot looked at him thoughtfully. “I am very anxious, Messieurs, that he should not be arrested.” “I dare say,” observed Summerhaye sarcastically.",0
"Another little detail confirmed my belief that she was not speaking the truth. The wrist watch, Hastings, the wrist watch!” Again that wrist watch! Poirot was eyeing me curiously. “You see, mon ami? You comprehend?” “No,” I replied with some ill humour. “I neither see nor comprehend. You make all these confounded mysteries, and it’s useless asking you to explain. You always like keeping everything up your sleeve to the last minute.” “Do not enrage yourself, my friend,” said Poirot with a smile. “I will explain if you wish.",0
"“Neither do I see. I tell you, mon ami, it puzzles me. Me Hercule Poirot!” “But if you believe him innocent, how do you explain his buying the strychnine?” “Very simply. He did not buy it.” “But Mace recognized him!” “I beg your pardon, he saw a man with a black beard like Mr. Inglethorp’s, and wearing glasses like Mr. Inglethorp, and dressed in Mr. Inglethorp’s rather noticeable clothes. He could not recognize a man whom he had probably only seen in the distance, since, you remember, he himself had only been in the village a fortnight, and Mrs. Inglethorp dealt principally with Coot’s in Tadminster.",0
"I had seen very little of him for some years. Indeed, I had never known him particularly well. He was a good fifteen years my senior, for one thing, though he hardly looked his forty-five years. As a boy, though, I had often stayed at Styles, his mother’s place in Essex. We had a good yarn about old times, and it ended in his inviting me down to Styles to spend my leave there. “The mater will be delighted to see you again after all those years,” he added. “Your mother keeps well?” I asked. “Oh, yes. I suppose you know that she has married again?” I am afraid I showed my surprise rather plainly. Mrs.",0
"Here is a shrewd and scheming woman who, knowing of her husband’s financial débâcle and tired of the elderly mate she has only married for his money, induces him to insure his life for a large sum, and then seeks for the means to accomplish her purpose. An accident gives her that the young soldier’s strange story. The next afternoon when monsieur le capitaine, as she thinks, is on the high seas, she and her husband are strolling round the grounds. ‘What a curious story that was last night!’ she observes.",0
"” The note, in Tuppence’s well-known schoolboy writing, ran as follows: “DEAR JULIUS, “It’s always better to have things in black and white. I don’t feel I can be bothered to think of marriage until Tommy is found. Let’s leave it till then. “Yours affectionately, “TUPPENCE.” Tommy handed it back, his eyes shining. His feelings had undergone a sharp reaction. He now felt that Tuppence was all that was noble and disinterested. Had she not refused Julius without hesitation? True, the note betokened signs of weakening, but he could excuse that.",0
"“And yet,” sighed the magistrate, “it promised at the beginning to be such a beautiful and simple case!” He caught Mrs. Renauld’s eye, and blushed in immediate confusion. “Ah, yes,” he coughed, turning over the papers on the table. “Let me see, where were we? Oh, the weapon. I fear this may give you pain, M. Renauld. I understand it was a present from you to your mother. Very sad very distressing ” Jack Renauld leaned forward. His face, which had flushed during the perusal of the letter, was now deadly white. “Do you mean that it was with an aeroplane wire paper cutter that my father was was killed? But it’s impossible! A little thing like that!” “Alas, M.",0
"“The money is conveyed in easily enough thanks to our colleague here.” Another voice, which Tommy fancied was that of the tall, commanding-looking man whose face had seemed familiar to him, said: “Think of the feelings of Belfast if they could hear you!” “That is settled, then,” said the sibilant tones. “Now, in the matter of the loan to an English newspaper, you have arranged the details satisfactorily, Boris?” “I think so.” “That is good. An official denial from Moscow will be forthcoming if necessary.” There was a pause, and then the clear voice of the German broke the silence: “I am directed by Mr.",0
"As her eyes fell on me, a sudden pang of guilt shot through me. This was the woman who had warned me so earnestly, and to whose warning I had, alas, paid no heed! How soon, and how contemptuously, I had dismissed it from my mind. Now that she had been proved justified in so tragic a manner, I felt ashamed. She had known Alfred Inglethorp only too well. I wondered whether, if she had remained at Styles, the tragedy would have taken place, or would the man have feared her watchful eyes? I was relieved when she shook me by the hand, with her well remembered painful grip.",0
"“Inspector Japp, C.I.D. Scotland Yard again. Another man this time. What does he expect I can tell him that I didn’t tell the first chap? I hope they haven’t lost that photograph. That Western photographer’s place was burned down and all his negatives destroyed this is the only copy in existence. I got it from the principal of the college there.” An unformulated dread swept over Tuppence. “You you don’t know the name of the man who came this morning?” “Yes, I do. No, I don’t. Half a second. It was on his card. Oh, I know! Inspector Brown. Quiet, unassuming sort of chap.",0
"And a few minutes later another phrase floated up to me, in an even more acid voice: “I agree with you! She is certainly very good-looking.” It is really a very hard life. Men will not be nice to you if you are not good-looking, and women will not be nice to you if you are. With a deep sigh I proceeded to do things to my hair. I have nice hair. It is black a real black, not dark brown, and it grows well back from my forehead and down over the ears. With a ruthless hand I dragged it upwards. As ears, my ears are quite all right, but there is no doubt about it, ears are démodé nowadays.",0
"“And their children were just like children are to-day they played with handfuls of pebbles, piling them up and knocking them down, and the more cleverly they balanced them, the better pleased they were. If I were to give a name to this place I should call it ‘The Country of Giant Children.’” “Perhaps you’re nearer the mark than you know,” said Colonel Race gravely. “Simple, primitive, big that is Africa.” I nodded appreciatively. “You love it, don’t you?” I asked. “Yes. But to live in it long well, it makes one what you would call cruel.",0
"""Just as you like,” replied Tommy. “I know it’s the fashion to run down the police. I rather believe in them myself.” His manner was nonchalant to the last degree. Tommy Beresford was one of those young Englishmen not distinguished by any special intellectual ability, but who are emphatically at their best in what is known as a “tight place.” Their natural diffidence and caution fall from them like a glove. Tommy realized perfectly that in his own wits lay the only chance of escape, and behind his casual manner he was racking his brains furiously.",0
"” He looked keenly at Lord Estair, who made a gesture of despair. “I can only tell you, Monsieur Poirot, that, if anyone had suggested to me yesterday that O’Murphy was a traitor, I should have laughed in his face.” “And to-day?” “To-day I do not know what to think.” Poirot nodded gravely. He looked at his turnip of a watch again. “I understand that I have carte blanche, messieurs in every way, I mean? I must be able to go where I choose, and how I choose.” “Perfectly. There is a special train leaving for Dover in an hour’s time, with a further contingent from Scotland Yard.",0
"""Ah!” I said slowly. “But what about me?” “That’s just it,” said Sir Eustace softly. “What about you? I’ve got you here I don’t want to rub it in in any way but I’ve got you here very neatly. The question is, what am I going to do with you? The simplest way of disposing of you and, I may add, the pleasantest to myself is the way of marriage. Wives can’t accuse their husbands, you know, and I’d rather like a pretty young wife to hold my hand and glance at me out of liquid eyes don’t flash them at me so! You quite frighten me.",0
"Unwittingly, Mademoiselle Marthe told us the truth on another point and incidentally gave Jack Renauld the lie. Did you notice his hesitation when I asked him if he saw Marthe Daubreuil on the night of the crime? He paused and then said ‘Yes.’ I suspected that he was lying. It was necessary for me to see Mademoiselle Marthe before he could put her on her guard. Three little words gave me the information I wanted. When I asked her if she knew that Jack Renauld was here that night, she answered ‘He told me.",0
"""A very just observation, madame. We may take it, then, that he left early on the following morning and that is reassuring from one point of view. He is not likely to have fallen a victim to any Apache assault at that hour. His baggage, now, was it all left behind?"" Mrs. Halliday seemed rather reluctant to answer, but at last she said: - ""No he must have taken one small suit-case with him."" ""H'm,"" said Poirot thoughtfully, ""I wonder where he was that evening. If we knew that, we should know a great deal. Whom did he meet? there lies the mystery.",0
"“I thought I thought it was the master it looked like ’im.” I saw Mrs. Maltravers give a terrified start, and my mind flew to the old superstition that a suicide cannot rest. She thought of it too, I am sure, for a minute later, she caught Poirot’s arm with a scream. “Didn’t you hear that? Those three taps on the window? That’s how he always used to tap when he passed round the house.” “The ivy,” I cried. “It was the ivy against the pane.” But a sort of terror was gaining on us all. The parlourmaid was obviously unstrung, and when the meal was over Mrs. Maltravers besought Poirot not to go at once. She was clearly terrified to be left alone. We sat in the little morning-room.",0
"He came out furious from the interview his friend was waiting for him. A week later war was declared. The two friends enlisted together. You know what happened. The best pal a man ever had was killed, partly through his own mad recklessness in rushing into unnecessary danger. He died with his name tarnished. “I swear to you, Anne, that it was mainly on his account that I was so bitter against that woman. It had gone deeper with him than with me.",0
"Five minutes later he reappeared, handed her back the keys and explained that he feared the house would not suit them. Mrs. James did not see the lady, but thought that she had gone on ahead. What she did notice was that the young man seemed very much upset about something. “He looked like a man who’d seen a ghost. I thought he was taken ill.” On the following day another lady and gentleman came to see the property and discovered the body lying on the floor in one of the upstairs rooms. Mrs. James identified it as that of the lady who had come the day before. The house-agents also recognized it as that of “Mrs. de Castina.",0
"I don’t know if it was a letter, or just a piece of paper, but it had writing on it, and she kept staring at it, almost as if she couldn’t believe what was written there. She whispered to herself, as though she had forgotten I was there: ‘These few words and everything’s changed.’ And then she says to me: ‘Never trust a man, Dorcas, they’re not worth it!’ I hurried off, and got her a good strong cup of tea, and she thanked me, and said she’d feel better when she’d drunk it. ‘I don’t know what to do,’ she says. ‘Scandal between husband and wife is a dreadful thing, Dorcas.",0
"""I’ll do anything I can to help you, I’m sure,” replied the young soldier; “but I’m afraid I didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary. You see, although Maltravers was an old friend of my people’s, I didn’t know him very well myself.” “You came down when?” “Tuesday afternoon. I went up to town early Wednesday morning, as my boat sailed from Tilbury about twelve o’clock. But some news I got made me alter my plans, as I dare say you heard me explain to Mrs. Maltravers.” “You were returning to East Africa, I understand?” “Yes. I’ve been out there ever since the War a great country.” “Exactly.",0
"The position is much as though they had got hold of an incriminating document, but couldn’t read it because it was in cipher but we know that the draft treaty wasn’t in cipher couldn’t be in the nature of things so that won’t wash. But there’s something. Of course, Jane Finn may be dead for all we know but I don’t think so. The curious thing is that they’re trying to get information about the girl from us.” “What?” “Yes. One or two little things have cropped up. And your story, little lady, confirms my idea. They know we’re looking for Jane Finn.",0
"Several very surprising things have occurred. To begin with, I met Augustus Milray, the most perfect example of an old ass the present Government has produced. His manner oozed diplomatic secrecy as he drew me aside in the Club into a quiet corner. He talked a good deal. About South Africa and the industrial situation there. About the growing rumours of a strike on the Rand. Of the secret causes actuating that strike. I listened as patiently as I could.",0
"One of the men stooped and seemed to push on something when, without a sound, the huge mass of rock turned on itself and disclosed a small tunnel-like opening leading into the mountain-side. Into this we were hurried. For some time the tunnel was narrow, but presently it widened, and before very long we came out into a wide rocky chamber lighted by electricity. There the gags were removed. At a sign from Number Four, who stood facing us with mocking triumph in his face, we were searched and every article was removed from our pockets, including Poirot's little automatic pistol.",0
"“You see,” explained Tuppence still sweetly, “I’m so very fond of money!” “You’re about the limit, that’s what you are,” growled Whittington, with a sort of unwilling admiration. “You took me in all right. Thought you were quite a meek little kid with just enough brains for my purpose.” “Life,” moralized Tuppence, “is full of surprises.” “All the same,” continued Whittington, “some one’s been talking. You say it isn’t Rita. Was it ? Oh, come in.” The clerk followed his discreet knock into the room, and laid a paper at his master’s elbow.",0
"""He has just arrived in London, I see by this,"" I said, tapping the letter. ""Shall you call upon him, and make your apologies in person?"" ""I might do so."" Two days later, Poirot returned to our rooms in a state of boundless excitement. He grasped me by both hands in his most impulsive manner. ""My friend, an occasion stupendous, unprecedented, never to be repeated, has presented itself! But there is danger, grave danger. I should not even ask you to attempt it."" If Poirot was trying to frighten me, he was going the wrong way to work, and so I told him. Becoming less incoherent, he unfolded his plan.",0
"“But you haven’t told me how you came to be wandering about so conveniently for me?” I said hastily, to cover his confusion. “I couldn’t sleep. I was restless disturbed had the feeling something was going to happen. In the end I took the boat and came ashore and tramped down towards the Falls. I was just at the head of the palm gully when I heard you scream.” “Why didn’t you get help from the hotel instead of carting me all the way here?” I asked. He flushed again. “I suppose it seems an unpardonable liberty to you but I don’t think that even now you realize your danger! You think I should have informed your friends? Pretty friends, who allowed you to be decoyed out to death.",0
"Tommy remained on the opposite side of the road while Tuppence plunged into the building. Tommy strolled slowly down to the end of the street, then back again. Just as he came abreast of the building, Tuppence darted across the road. “Tommy!” “Yes. What’s up?” “The place is shut. I can’t make anyone hear.” “That’s odd.” “Isn’t it? Come up with me, and let’s try again.” Tommy followed her. As they passed the third floor landing a young clerk came out of an office. He hesitated a moment, then addressed himself to Tuppence. “Were you wanting the Esthonia Glassware?” “Yes, please.",0
"Why was I to stand in this particular spot on guard? I looked thoughtfully down the corridor in front of me. An idea struck me. With the exception of Cynthia Murdoch’s, everyone’s room was in this left wing. Had that anything to do with it? Was I to report who came or went? I stood faithfully at my post. The minutes passed. Nobody came. Nothing happened. It must have been quite twenty minutes before Poirot rejoined me. “You have not stirred?” “No, I’ve stuck here like a rock. Nothing’s happened.” “Ah!” Was he pleased, or disappointed? “You’ve seen nothing at all?” “No.",0
"""Mon ami, a clue of two feet long is every bit as valuable as one measuring two millimetres! But it is the romantic idea that all important clues must be infinitesimal! As to the piece of lead-piping having nothing to do with the crime, you say that because Giraud told you so. No” as I was about to interpose a question “we will say no more. Leave Giraud to his search, and me to my ideas. The case seems straightforward enough and yet and yet, mon ami, I am not satisfied! And do you know why? Because of the wrist watch that is two hours fast. And then there are several curious little points that do not seem to fit in.",0
"What did it mean this apparently innocent-sounding missive? Did it concern some business deal which Ryland was undertaking, and was he anxious that no details about it should leak out until it was carried through? That was a possible explanation. But I remembered the small figure 4 with which the envelopes were marked, and I felt that, at last, I was on the track of the thing we were seeking. I puzzled over the letter all that evening, and most of the next day and then suddenly the solution came to me. It was so simple, too. The figure 4 was the clue.",0
"Hercule Poirot, imploring assistance. “Telegram sent to Jack Renauld, bidding him proceed by the Anzora to Buenos Ayres. “Chauffeur, Masters, sent off on a holiday. “Visit of a lady, that evening. As he is seeing her out, his words are ‘Yes, yes but for God’s sake go now.…’” Poirot paused. “There, Hastings, take each of those facts one by one, consider them carefully by themselves and in relation to the whole, and see if you do not get new light on the matter.” I endeavoured conscientiously to do as he had said.",0
"For the rest, she cooked like a chef, as Tuppence had an opportunity of judging that evening. Mrs. Vandemeyer was expecting a guest to dinner, and Tuppence accordingly laid the beautifully polished table for two. She was a little exercised in her own mind as to this visitor. It was highly possible that it might prove to be Whittington. Although she felt fairly confident that he would not recognize her, yet she would have been better pleased had the guest proved to be a total stranger. However, there was nothing for it but to hope for the best.",0
"‘But perhaps I could speak to his niece Nurse Edith, did you say her name was?’ “But the doctor shook his head. ‘I’m afraid that, too, is impossible. Nurse Edith left with a patient to-night also.’ ‘I seem to be real unlucky,’ I remarked. ‘Have you Mr. Whittington’s address in town? I guess I’d like to look him up when I get back.’ ‘I don’t know his address. I can write to Nurse Edith for it if you like.’ I thanked him. ‘Don’t say who it is wants it. I’d like to give him a little surprise.’ “That was about all I could do for the moment.",0
"“I figure to myself that that is the room where we shall find Jack Renauld.” Madame Daubreuil opened the door to us. She explained that Jack was much the same, but perhaps we would like to see for ourselves. She led us upstairs and into the bedroom. Marthe Daubreuil was embroidering by a table with a lamp on it. She put her finger to her lips as we entered. Jack Renauld was sleeping an uneasy fitful sleep, his head turning from side to side, and his face still unduly flushed. “Is the doctor coming again?” asked Poirot in a whisper. “Not unless we send. He is sleeping that is the great thing.",0
"“Pourquoi? Neither will makes any provision for them, and they are more likely to be kept on with Miss Marsh than if the place became the property of a hospital. How could it be to anyone’s advantage to destroy the will? The hospitals benefit yes; but one cannot suspect institutions.” “Perhaps the old man changed his mind and destroyed it himself,” I suggested. Poirot rose to his feet, dusting his knees with his usual care. “That may be,” he admitted. “One of your more sensible observations, Hastings. Well, we can do no more here. We have done all that mortal man can do.",0
"Had they any clue, or would the whole thing remain in the category of undiscovered crimes? After breakfast, Dorcas came up to me rather mysteriously, and asked if she might have a few words with me. “Certainly. What is it, Dorcas?” “Well, it’s just this, sir. You’ll be seeing the Belgian gentleman to-day perhaps?” I nodded. “Well, sir, you know how he asked me so particular if the mistress, or anyone else, had a green dress?” “Yes, yes. You have found one?” My interest was aroused. “No, not that, sir.",0
"“Most of what followed seems like a nightmare still. I see it in my dreams sometimes I’ll hurry over that part. Mr. Danvers had told me to watch out. He might have been shadowed from New York, but he didn’t think so. At first I had no suspicions, but on the boat to Holyhead I began to get uneasy. There was one woman who had been very keen to look after me, and chum up with me generally a Mrs. Vandemeyer. At first I’d been only grateful to her for being so kind to me; but all the time I felt there was something about her I didn’t like, and on the Irish boat I saw her talking to some queer-looking men, and from the way they looked I saw that they were talking about me.",0
"“Because of Beresford?” “No, no, no!” “Well then?” Tuppence merely continued to shake her head violently. “You can’t reasonably expect more dollars than I’ve got.” “Oh, it isn’t that,” gasped Tuppence with an almost hysterical laugh. “But thanking you very much, and all that, I think I’d better say no.” “I’d be obliged if you’d do me the favour to think it over until to-morrow.” “It’s no use.” “Still, I guess we’ll leave it like that.” “Very well,” said Tuppence meekly. Neither of them spoke again until they reached the Ritz. Tuppence went upstairs to her room.",0
"The 29th was the much-talked-of “Labour Day,” about which all sorts of rumours were running riot. Newspapers were getting agitated. Sensational hints of a Labour coup d’état were freely reported. The Government said nothing. It knew and was prepared. There were rumours of dissension among the Labour leaders. They were not of one mind. The more far-seeing among them realized that what they proposed might well be a death-blow to the England that at heart they loved.",0
"But I should have wasted my time if I had gone. It is the same with so called ‘experts.’ Remember the handwriting testimony in the Cavendish Case. One counsel’s questioning brings out testimony as to the resemblances, the defence brings evidence to show dissimilarity. All the language is very technical. And the result? What we all knew in the first place. The writing was very like that of John Cavendish. And the psychological mind is faced with the question ‘Why?’ Because it was actually his? Or because some one wished us to think it was his? I answered that question, mon ami, and answered it correctly.” And Poirot, having effectually silenced, if not convinced me, leaned back with a satisfied air.",0
"He is the sort of man who never notices legs himself or, if he does, would die sooner than say so. Also he thinks my appreciation of such things frivolous. I like annoying Pagett, so I continued maliciously: “As you’ve made her acquaintance, you might ask her to dine at our table to-morrow night. It’s the Fancy Dress dance. By the way, you’d better go down to the barber and select a fancy costume for me.” “Surely you will not go in fancy dress?” said Pagett, in tones of horror. I could see that it was quite incompatible with his idea of my dignity. He looked shocked and pained.",0
"It was the Prime Minister! “For Heaven’s sake, tell me all about it,” I cried impatiently, as Poirot, Norman, and I motored back to London. “How in the world did they manage to smuggle him back to England?” “There was no need to smuggle him back,” replied Poirot dryly. “The Prime Minister has never left England. He was kidnapped on his way from Windsor to London.” “What?” “I will make all clear. The Prime Minister was in his car, his secretary beside him. Suddenly a pad of chloroform is clapped on his face” “But by whom?” “By the clever linguistic Captain Daniels. As soon as the Prime Minister is unconscious, Daniels picks up the speaking-tube, and directs O’Murphy to turn to the right, which the chauffeur, quite unsuspicious, does.",0
"” I shuddered. Then a thought struck me. “You say you didn’t know I was there. What about the note then?” “What note?” “The note you sent me, asking me to meet you in the clearing.” He stared at me. “I sent no note.” I felt myself flushing up to the roots of my hair. Fortunately he did not seem to notice. “How did you come to be on the spot in such a marvellous manner?” I asked in as nonchalant a manner as I could assume. “And what are you doing in this part of the world, anyway?” “I live here,” he said simply. “On this island?” “Yes, I came here after the War.",0
"“I? Never! What a game!” He became excited. “Figure to yourself, each hole it is of a different length. The obstacles, they are not arranged mathematically. Even the greens are frequently up one side! There is only one pleasing thing the how do you call them? tee boxes! They, at least, are symmetrical.” I could not refrain from a laugh at the way the game appeared to Poirot, and my little friend smiled at me affectionately, bearing no malice. Then he asked: “But M. Renauld, without doubt he played the golf?” “Yes, he was a keen golfer.",0
"""And how long had you been playing when the tragedy happened?"" ""It must have been about the third or fourth move when Wilson suddenly fell forward over the table, stone dead."" Poirot rose to depart. He flung out his last question as though it was of absolutely no importance, but I knew better. ""Had he had anything to eat or drink?"" ""A whisky and soda, I think."" ""Thank you, Dr. Savaronoff. I will disturb you no longer."" Ivan was in the hall to show us out. Poirot lingered on the threshold. ""The flat below this, do you know who lives there?"" ""Sir Charles Kingwell, a member of Parliament, sir.",0
"Desjardeaux,"" said Crowther. ""Allow me to introduce to you M. Hercule Poirot of whom you may, perhaps, already have heard."" The Frenchman bowed and shook hands. ""I have indeed heard of M. Hercule Poirot,"" he said pleasantly. ""Who has not?"" ""You are too amiable, monsieur,"" said Poirot, bowing, but his face flushed with pleasure. ""Any word for an old friend?"" asked a quiet voice, and a man came forward from a corner by a tall bookcase. It was our old acquaintance, Mr. Ingles. Poirot shook him warmly by the hand. ""And now, M. Poirot,"" said Crowther. ""We are at your service.",0
"Then I realized by the pig-tail and the embroidered robe that he was a Chinaman.” She stopped with a shudder. The butler reappeared. He spoke in a low voice to Lord Yardly. “A gentleman from Mr. Hoffberg’s, m’lord. He says you expect him.” “Good heavens!” cried the distracted nobleman. “I must see him, I suppose. No, not here, Mullings, in the library.” I drew Poirot aside.",0
"If they caught me now they’d ” Her eyes opened wide and staring. “Don’t!” implored Tuppence. “Lie back, and don’t think. You can be quite sure that Tommy wouldn’t have said it was safe if it wasn’t.” “My cousin didn’t think so. He didn’t want us to do this.” “No,” said Tuppence, rather embarrassed. “What are you thinking of?” said Jane sharply. “Why?” “Your voice was so queer!” “I was thinking of something,” confessed Tuppence. “But I don’t want to tell you not now. I may be wrong, but I don’t think so. It’s just an idea that came into my head a long time ago. Tommy’s got it too I’m almost sure he has.",0
"There are the death duties, of course, but half my father’s money goes with the place, and Lawrence will stay with us for the present, so there is his share as well. We shall be pinched at first, of course, because, as I once told you, I am in a bit of a hole financially myself. Still, the Johnnies will wait now.” In the general relief at Inglethorp’s approaching departure, we had the most genial breakfast we had experienced since the tragedy.",0
"They looked a pair of extremely piquant children. They began to sing. Their voices were fresh and true, rather thin and music-hally, but attractive. It was quite a pretty little turn. They danced neatly, and did some clever little acrobatic feats. The words of their songs were crisp and catchy. When the curtain fell, there was a full meed of applause. Evidently the Dulcibella Kids were a success. Suddenly I felt that I could remain no longer. I must get out into the air. I suggested leaving to Poirot. “Go by all means, mon ami. I amuse myself, and will stay to the end.",0
"Secondly, the open way in which he pawned the ring makes it unlikely that he did murder to get it. Thirdly, your sneak-thief is rarely a murderer. Fourthly, as he has been in prison since Saturday, it would be too much of a coincidence that he is able to give so accurate a description of Lowen.” Japp nodded. “I don’t say you’re not right. But all the same, you won’t get a jury to take much note of a jailbird’s evidence. What seems odd to me is that Lowen couldn’t find a cleverer way of disposing of the ring.” Poirot shrugged his shoulders.",0
"We are in darkness. A hundred conflicting points confuse and worry us. That is well. That is excellent. Out of confusion comes forth order. But if you find order to start with, if a crime seems simple and above-board, eh bien, méfiez vous! It is, how do you say it? cooked! The great criminal is simple but very few criminals are great. In trying to cover up their tracks, they invariably betray themselves. Ah, mon ami, I would that some day I could meet a really great criminal one who commits his crime, and then does nothing! Even I, Hercule Poirot, might fail to catch such a one.” But I had not followed his words. A light had burst upon me. “Poirot! Mrs.",0
"I began rather tactfully, I thought, but I had not gone far before she stopped me authoritatively. “You are an excellent advocate, I have no doubt, Mr. Hastings, but in this case your talents are quite thrown away. Cynthia will run no risk of encountering any unkindness from me.” I began to stammer feebly that I hoped she hadn’t thought But again she stopped me, and her words were so unexpected that they quite drove Cynthia, and her troubles, out of my mind. “Mr.",0
"“Being up in the air has done me good.” “Nothing like fresh air,” said Colonel Race, smiling. “Being shut up in those stuffy cabins would kill any one,” declared Mrs. Blair, dropping into a seat by my side and dismissing her companion with a little nod. “You’ve got an outside one, I hope?” I shook my head. “My dear girl! Why don’t you change? There’s plenty of room. A lot of people got off at Madeira, and the boat’s very empty. Talk to the purser about it. He’s a nice little boy he changed me into a beautiful cabin because I didn’t care for the one I’d got. You talk to him at lunch-time when you go down.” I shuddered.",0
"My friend had been foully murdered. Was I to go tamely back to South America without an effort to bring his murderers to justice? I said all this and more to Ridgeway, who listened attentively enough. ""All the same,"" he said when I had finished, ""my advice does not vary. I am earnestly convinced that Poirot himself, if he were here, would urge you to return. In his name, I beg of you, Hastings, abandon these wild ideas and go back to your ranch."" To that only one answer was possible, and, shaking his head sadly, he said no more. It was a month before I was fully restored to health.",0
"I told him that if the facts were laid before me, I would give him my expert opinion. But that he professed himself unable to do. I was to be put in possession of the facts only on my arrival out there. Normally, that would have closed the matter. To dictate to Hercule Poirot is sheer impertinence. But the sum offered was so stupendous that for the first time in my life I was tempted by mere money. It was a competence a fortune! And there was a second attraction you, my friend. For this last year and a half I have been a very lonely old man.",0
"He wore an overcoat buttoned up to his chin, and a soft hat well pulled down over his eyes. ""Excuse me, gentlemen, for my somewhat unceremonious entry,"" he said in a soft voice, ""but my business is of a rather unorthodox nature."" Smiling, he advanced to the table and sat down by it. I was about to spring up, but Poirot restrained me with a gesture. ""As you say, Monsieur, your entry is somewhat unceremonious. Will you kindly state your business?"" ""My dear M. Poirot, it is very simple. You have been annoying my friends."" ""In what way?"" ""Come, come, Monsieur Poirot. You do not seriously ask me that? You know as well as I do.",0
"""Besides,” added Tommy, as an afterthought, “I’ve great faith in Tuppence.” The journey was wearisome, with many stops, and crowded carriages. They had to change twice, once at Doncaster, once at a small junction. Ebury was a deserted station with a solitary porter, to whom Tommy addressed himself: “Can you tell me the way to the Moat House?” “The Moat House? It’s a tidy step from here. The big house near the sea, you mean?” Tommy assented brazenly. After listening to the porter’s meticulous but perplexing directions, they prepared to leave the station.",0
"The lift-boy is deep in talk with one of the pages. The lift-bell has rung three times, but he heeds it not. Thirdly, even the waiters are distrait; and to make a waiter distrait” Poirot shook his head with an air of finality. “The affair must indeed be of the first magnitude. Ah, it is as I thought! Here come the police.” Two men had just entered the hotel one in uniform, the other in plain clothes. They spoke to a page, and were immediately ushered upstairs. A few minutes later, the same boy descended and came up to where we were sitting. “Mr.",0
"This street, it is not aristocratic, mon ami! In it there is no fashionable doctor, no fashionable dentist still less is there a fashionable milliner! But there is a fashionable detective. Oui, my friend, it is true I am become the mode, the dernier cri! One says to another: ‘Comment? You have lost your gold pencil-case? You must go to the little Belgian. He is too marvellous! Every one goes! Courez!’ And they arrive! In flocks, mon ami! With problems of the most foolish!” A bell rang below. “What did I tell you? That is Miss Marvell.",0
"What do you think I found?” I shook my head. “This!” Pagett held up a safety razor and a stick of shaving soap. “What should a woman want with these?” I don’t suppose Pagett ever reads the advertisements in the high-class ladies’ papers. I do. Whilst not proposing to argue with him on the subject, I refused to accept the presence of the razor as proof positive of Miss Pettigrew’s sex. Pagett is so hopelessly behind the times. I should not have been at all surprised if he had produced a cigarette-case to support his theory. However, even Pagett has his limits. “You’re not convinced, Sir Eustace. What do you say to this?” I inspected the article which he dangled aloft triumphantly.",0
"“But what is there in him that attracts you so? I don’t see that there’s anything in him at all except his rather reckless good looks and his modern Sheik-cum-Stone-Age love-making.” I poured out the vials of my wrath upon Suzanne for some minutes. “Just because you’re comfortably married and getting fat, you’ve forgotten that there’s any such thing as romance,” I ended. “Oh, I’m not getting fat, Anne. All the worry I’ve had about you lately must have worn me to a shred.” “You look particularly well nourished,” I said coldly. “I should say you must have put on about half a stone.",0
"“Just carry up my despatch-case, will you, dear? I’m going to bed.” The door into the hall was a wide one. I had risen when Cynthia did, John was close by me. There were therefore three witnesses who could swear that Mrs. Inglethorp was carrying her coffee, as yet untasted, in her hand. My evening was utterly and entirely spoilt by the presence of Dr. Bauerstein. It seemed to me the man would never go. He rose at last, however, and I breathed a sigh of relief. “I’ll walk down to the village with you,” said Mr. Inglethorp. “I must see our agent over those estate accounts.” He turned to John. “No one need sit up.",0
"That was my one fear, that I should have to dispose of them before I had reached the place where you were concealed, and that I should have to search for you perhaps in vain afterwards."" ""Dispose of them, did you say?"" I asked feebly. ""Single-handed."" ""Oh, there is nothing very clever about that. If one is prepared in advance all is simple the motto of the Boy Scout, is it not? And a very fine one. Me, I was prepared. Not so long ago, I rendered a service to a very famous chemist, who did a lot of work in connection with poison gas during the war.",0
"“Mary ” For a moment, I thought she wavered. A softer expression came over her face, then suddenly she turned almost fiercely away. “None!” She was walking away when John sprang after her, and caught her by the arm. “Mary” his voice was very quiet now “are you in love with this fellow Bauerstein?” She hesitated, and suddenly there swept across her face a strange expression, old as the hills, yet with something eternally young about it. So might some Egyptian sphinx have smiled. She freed herself quietly from his arm, and spoke over her shoulder.",0
"He likes out of-the-way parts of the world.” “No one else goes with you?” Jack flushed. “You mean ?” “A girl who loves you very dearly who has been willing to lay down her life for you.” “How could I ask her?” muttered the boy. “After all that has happened, could I go to her and oh, what sort of a lame story could I tell?” “Les femmes they have a wonderful genius for manufacturing crutches for stories like that.” “Yes, but I’ve been such a damned fool!” “So have all of us, at one time and another,” observed Poirot philosophically. But Jack’s face had hardened. “There’s something else.",0
"John Eardsley was arrested. In his possession was found a portion of the De Beer diamonds. “But the case never came to court. Sir Laurence Eardsley paid over a sum equal to the missing diamonds and De Beers did not prosecute. Exactly how the robbery was committed has never been known. But the knowledge that his son was a thief broke the old man’s heart. He had a stroke shortly afterwards. As for John, his Fate was in a way merciful. He enlisted, went to the War, fought there bravely, and was killed, thus wiping out the stain on his name. Sir Laurence himself had a third stroke and died about a month ago.",0
"“It shows clearly enough that my poor old friend had just found out she’d been made a fool of!” “It says nothing of the kind in the letter,” the Coroner pointed out. “No, because Emily never could bear to put herself in the wrong. But I know her. She wanted me back. But she wasn’t going to own that I’d been right. She went round about. Most people do. Don’t believe in it myself.” Mr. Wells smiled faintly. So, I noticed, did several of the jury. Miss Howard was obviously quite a public character. “Anyway, all this tomfoolery is a great waste of time,” continued the lady, glancing up and down the jury disparagingly.",0
"""Well, my friend, I saw there was just one chance. I was not sure then if Inglethorp was the criminal or not, but if he was I reasoned that he would not have the paper on him, but would have hidden it somewhere, and by enlisting the sympathy of the household I could effectually prevent his destroying it.",0
"“Now then,” said Tommy, “where shall we go?” The very faint anxiety which underlay his tone did not escape the astute ears of Miss Prudence Cowley, known to her intimate friends for some mysterious reason as “Tuppence.” She pounced at once. “Tommy, you’re stony!” “Not a bit of it,” declared Tommy unconvincingly. “Rolling in cash.” “You always were a shocking liar,” said Tuppence severely, “though you did once persuade Sister Greenbank that the doctor had ordered you beer as a tonic, but forgotten to write it on the chart. Do you remember?” Tommy chuckled.",0
"But his actions now were decidedly peculiar, to say the least of them. Leaning forward, he deliberately helped me to salt, putting it in four little heaps round the edge of my plate. ""You will excuse me,"" he said, in a melancholy voice. ""To help a stranger to salt is to help them to sorrow, they say. That may be an unavoidable necessity. I hope not, though. I hope that you will be reasonable."" Then, with a certain significance, he repeated his operations with the salt on his own plate. The symbol 4 was too plain to be missed. I looked at him searchingly.",0
"His arrangements completed, he makes an appointment with Mr. Lowen (who has been imprudent enough in the past to cross the great man once or twice), drills a hole in the safe, leaves orders that the guest is to be shown into the study, and walks out of the house where?” Poirot stopped, and stretched out his hand for another boiled egg. He frowned.",0
"What kept her there the hope of seeing Jack Renauld? I had told her (as at the time we believed) that he was on the high seas en route to Buenos Ayres. Possibly she was aware that the Anzora had not sailed. But to know that she must have seen Jack. Was that what Poirot was after? Had Jack Renauld, returning to see Marthe Daubreuil, come face to face instead with Bella Duveen, the girl he had heartlessly thrown over? I began to see daylight. If that were indeed the case, it might furnish Jack with the alibi he needed. Yet under those circumstances his silence seemed difficult to explain.",0
"""How long are you keeping this radium in your possession?"" ""Only for two days more, monsieur. Then my experiments will be concluded."" Poirot's eyes brightened. ""And Inez Veroneau is aware of the fact? Good then our friends will come back. Not a word of me to any one, madame. But rest assured, I will save your radium for you. You have a key of the door leading from the laboratory to the garden?"" ""Yes, monsieur. Here it is. I have a duplicate for myself. And here is the key of the garden door leading out into the alleyway between this villa and the next one."" ""I thank you, madame.",0
"At once I saw the door swinging open.” “What about the other downstairs windows, were they all fastened?” “Every one of them. There was nothing suspicious or out of place anywhere.” “Good, Françoise, you can go.” The old woman shuffled towards the door. On the threshold she looked back. “I will tell you one thing, monsieur. That Madame Daubreuil she is a bad one! Oh, yes, one woman knows about another. She is a bad one, remember that.” And, shaking her head sagely, Françoise left the room. “Léonie Oulard,” called the magistrate. Léonie appeared dissolved in tears, and inclined to be hysterical. M. Hautet dealt with her adroitly.",0
"The name of the passenger who had arranged the transaction was Carton, and his description tallied exactly with that of the man killed on the Tube. So one mystery, at all events, was cleared up, and the diamonds were obviously the key to the whole situation. Those last days on the Kilmorden seemed to pass very quickly. As we drew nearer and nearer to Cape Town, I was forced to consider carefully my future plans. There were so many people I wanted to keep an eye on. Mr. Chichester, Sir Eustace and his secretary, and yes, Colonel Race! What was I to do about it? Naturally it was Chichester who had first claim on my attention. Indeed, I was on the point of reluctantly dismissing Sir Eustace and Mr.",0
"There isn’t another girl in the world who could have carried it through as you did. You were just wonderful!” Jane shook her head. “I don’t feel wonderful. At heart I’m just tired and lonesome and longing for my own country.” “That brings me to something I wanted to say. I heard the Ambassador telling you his wife hoped you would come to them at the Embassy right away. That’s good enough, but I’ve got another plan. Jane I want you to marry me! Don’t get scared and say no at once. You can’t love me right away, of course, that’s impossible.",0
"I’m my father’s son. Would any one marry me, knowing that?” “You are your father’s son, you say. Hastings here will tell you that I believe in heredity ” “Well, then ” “Wait. I know a woman, a woman of courage and endurance, capable of great love, of supreme self-sacrifice ” The boy looked up. His eyes softened. “My mother!” “Yes. You are your mother’s son as well as your father’s. Go then to Mademoiselle Bella. Tell her everything. Keep nothing back and see what she will say!” Jack looked irresolute. “Go to her as a boy no longer, but a man a man bowed by the fate of the Past, and the fate of Today, but looking forward to a new and wonderful life.",0
"I said that I felt I ought to remember something about it, that it was just as though it was all coming back, and then, before I could get hold of it, it went again. Then she told me that I was her niece, and that I was to call her ‘Aunt Rita.’ I did obediently, and she told me not to worry my memory would soon come back. “That was an awful night. I’d made my plan whilst I was waiting for her. The papers were safe so far, but I couldn’t take the risk of leaving them there any longer. They might throw that magazine away any minute. I lay awake waiting until I judged it must be about two o’clock in the morning.",0
"“The Villa Geneviève? Just a few steps up this road to the right, monsieur. You could see it if it were not for the curve.” The chauffeur thanked him, and started the car again. My eyes were fascinated by the girl who still stood, with one hand on the gate, watching us. I am an admirer of beauty, and here was one whom nobody could have passed without remark. Very tall, with the proportions of a young goddess, her uncovered golden head gleaming in the sunlight, I swore to myself that she was one of the most beautiful girls I had ever seen. As we swung up the rough road, I turned my head to look after her. “By Jove, Poirot,” I exclaimed, “did you see that young goddess.",0
"Poirot guessed my thoughts, for as soon as we were alone he remarked ironically: “At last you have seen the detective you admire the human foxhound! Is it not so, my friend?” “At any rate, he’s doing something,” I said, with asperity. “If there’s anything to find, he’ll find it. Now you ” “Eh bien! I also have found something! A piece of lead-piping.” “Nonsense, Poirot. You know very well that’s got nothing to do with it. I meant little things traces that may lead us infallibly to the murderers.",0
"It contained full and definite instructions for me to proceed forthwith to Johannesburg, or rather to a station this side of Johannesburg, where I should be met by a car. It was signed, not Andy, but Harry. I sat down in a chair to do some very serious thinking.  (From the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler)  Johannesburg,  March 7th. Pagett has arrived. He is in a blue funk of course. Suggested at once that we should go off to Pretoria.",0
"""Impossible! The housekeeper was with her when the shot was fired.” “Ah, yes, the housekeeper. But she has disappeared.” “She will be found.” “I think not. There is something peculiarly elusive about that housekeeper, don’t you think so, Hastings? It struck me at once.” “She played her part, I suppose, and then got out in the nick of time.” “And what was her part?” “Well, presumably to admit her confederate, the black-bearded man.” “Oh, no, that was not her part! Her part was what you have just mentioned, to provide an alibi for Mrs. Havering at the moment the shot was fired.",0
"It was written on one of those printed will forms, and witnessed by two of the servants not Dorcas.” “Did Mr. Inglethorp know of it?” “He says not.” “One might take that with a grain of salt,” I remarked sceptically. “All these wills are very confusing. Tell me, how did those scribbled words on the envelope help you to discover that a will was made yesterday afternoon?” Poirot smiled. “Mon ami, have you ever, when writing a letter, been arrested by the fact that you did not know how to spell a certain word?” “Yes, often. I suppose everyone has.” “Exactly. And have you not, in such a case, tried the word once or twice on the edge of the blotting-paper, or a spare scrap of paper, to see if it looked right? Well, that is what Mrs.",0
"” What was he going to make me tell him? I was afraid afraid. I looked him full in the face. My eyes can’t keep secrets like his, but they can carry the war into the enemy’s country. “What are you really doing here, Colonel Race?” I asked deliberately. For a moment I thought he wasn’t going to answer. He was clearly taken aback, though. At last he spoke, and his words seemed to afford him a grim amusement. “Pursuing ambition,” he said. “Just that pursuing ambition. You will remember, Miss Beddingfeld, that ‘by that sin fell the angels,’ etc.",0
"She is of a good height, her voice is deep and manly; moreover, remember, she and Inglethorp are cousins, and there is a distinct resemblance between them, especially in their gait and bearing. It was simplicity itself. They are a clever pair!” “I am still a little fogged as to how exactly the bromide business was done,” I remarked. “Bon! I will reconstruct for you as far as possible. I am inclined to think that Miss Howard was the master mind in that affair.",0
"""He's just conscious, but I doubt if he has the force to speak. He lost a terrible lot of blood, you know. I can administer a stimulant, of course, but we've already done all that is possible in that direction."" Nevertheless, he administered a hypodermic injection, and I stayed by the bed, hoping against hope for a word a sign that might be of the utmost value to me in my work. But the minutes sped on and no sign came.",0
"When ah! I heard that, I arranged for her to be removed to the house of a doctor a friend of mine, and wired at once for you. She relapsed into unconsciousness and has not spoken since.” “She’s not seriously hurt?” “Oh, a bruise and a cut or two; really, from a medical point of view, absurdly slight injuries to have produced such a condition. Her state is probably to be attributed to the mental shock consequent on recovering her memory.” “It’s come back?” cried Julius excitedly. Sir James tapped the table rather impatiently. “Undoubtedly, Mr. Hersheimmer, since she was able to give her real name. I thought you had appreciated that point.",0
"“But Mr. Renauld’s letter? It distinctly mentions a secret and Santiago?” “Undoubtedly there was a secret in M. Renauld’s life there can be no doubt of that. On the other hand, the word Santiago, to my mind, is a red herring, dragged continually across the track to put us off the scent. It is possible that it was used in the same way on M. Renauld, to keep him from directing his suspicions into a quarter nearer at hand. Oh, be assured, Hastings, the danger that threatened him was not in Santiago, it was near at hand, in France.” He spoke so gravely, and with such assurance, that I could not fail to be convinced.",0
"It is because you are trying to drown and stifle your instinct, which tells you another name ” “No, no, no!” cried Miss Howard wildly, flinging up her hands. “Don’t say it! Oh, don’t say it! It isn’t true! It can’t be true. I don’t know what put such a wild such a dreadful idea into my head!” “I am right, am I not?” asked Poirot. “Yes, yes; you must be a wizard to have guessed. But it can’t be so it’s too monstrous, too impossible. It must be Alfred Inglethorp.” Poirot shook his head gravely. “Don’t ask me about it,” continued Miss Howard, “because I shan’t tell you. I won’t admit it, even to myself. I must be mad to think of such a thing.",0
"It is this villainous sea that troubles me! The mal de mer it is horrible suffering!” “Oh!” I said, rather taken aback. The first throb of the engines was felt, and Poirot groaned and closed his eyes. “Major Norman has a map of Northern France if you would like to study it?” Poirot shook his head impatiently. “But no, but no! Leave me, my friend. See you, to think, the stomach and the brain must be in harmony. Laverguier has a method most excellent for averting the mal de mer. You breathe in and out slowly, so turning the head from left to right and counting six between each breath.” I left him to his gymnastic endeavours, and went on deck.",0
"Also I settled my hat at a more becoming angle. Then I settled myself to wait with patience for my enemy’s return. He reappeared in a subtly chastened mood. “Will you come this way, Miss Beddingfeld?” I followed him up the stairs. He knocked at the door of a room, a brisk “Come in” sounded from inside, and he opened the door and motioned to me to pass inside. Sir Eustace Pedler sprang up to greet me, genial and smiling. “Well, well, Miss Anne.” He shook me warmly by the hand. “I’m delighted to see you. Come and sit down. Not tired after your journey? That’s good.” He sat down facing me, still beaming. It left me rather at a loss. His manner was so completely natural.",0
"For instance, if the object of the murderers was revenge, why did they not stab Renauld in his sleep and have done with it?” “They wanted the ‘secret,’” I reminded him. Poirot brushed a speck of dust from his sleeve with a dissatisfied air. “Well, where is this ‘secret’? Presumably some distance away, since they wish him to dress himself. Yet he is found murdered close at hand, almost within ear-shot of the house. Then again, it is pure chance that a weapon such as the dagger should be lying about casually, ready to hand.",0
"But he was quick to take his cue from me and to cover them up. Once he spoke of the Mousterian period as succeeding the Aurignacian an absurd mistake for one who knew anything of the subject. It was twelve o’clock when I went to my cabin. I was still puzzling over those queer discrepancies. Was it possible that he had “got the whole subject up” for the occasion that really he knew nothing of archaeology? I shook my head, vaguely dissatisfied with that solution. Just as I was dropping off to sleep, I sat up with a sudden start as another idea flashed into my head.",0
"""Terrible, terrible,” said M. Hautet. “Permit me to introduce M. Bex our commissary of police, M. Giraud of the Sûreté. This gentleman is M. Hercule Poirot. M. Renauld sent for him, but he arrived too late to do anything to avert the tragedy. A friend of M. Poirot’s, Captain Hastings.” Stonor looked at Poirot with some interest. “Sent for you, did he?” “You did not know, then, that M. Renauld contemplated calling in a detective?” interposed M. Bex. “No, I didn’t. But it doesn’t surprise me a bit.” “Why?” “Because the old man was rattled! I don’t know what it was all about.",0
"Harper was saying, “I’ve only been six months with the expedition. Yes, I knew Mr. Bleibner’s affairs pretty well.” “Can you recount to me anything concerning his nephew?” “He turned up here one day, not a bad-looking fellow. I’d never met him before, but some of the others had Ames, I think, and Schneider. The old man wasn’t at all pleased to see him. They were at it in no time, hammer and tongs. ‘Not a cent,’ the old man shouted. ‘Not one cent now or when I’m dead. I intend to leave my money to the furtherance of my life’s work. I’ve been talking it over with Mr.",0
"” A slight cloud passed over the actress’s face, and she replied constrainedly: “I’m afraid that’s impossible.” “You have it with you hein?” Poirot was watching her narrowly. The girl hesitated a moment, then slipped her hand into the bosom of her gown, drawing out a long thin chain. She leaned forward, unclosing her hand. In the palm, a stone of white fire, exquisitely set in platinum, lay and winked at us solemnly. Poirot drew in his breath with a long hiss. “Épatant!” he murmured.",0
"le juge, but it was only for a flying visit. A side issue, but one that I fancied might repay investigation.” “And it did eh?” Poirot shrugged his shoulders. M. Hautet nodded, sighing. “We must resign ourselves, I fear. That animal Giraud, his manners are abominable, but he is undoubtedly clever! Not much chance of that one making a mistake.” “You think not, M. le juge?” It was the examining magistrate’s turn to shrug his shoulders. “Eh bien, speaking frankly in confidence, c’est entendu can you come to any other conclusion?” “Frankly, M.",0
"It must have been about a quarter of an hour later when the door of our sitting-room flew open, and a distracted female precipitated herself into the room. “Oh, doctor, you’re wanted! Such a terrible voice. It gave me a turn, it did indeed.” I recognized in our new visitor Dr. Hawker’s housekeeper, Miss Rider. The doctor was a bachelor, and lived in a gloomy old house a few streets away. The usually placid Miss Rider was now in a state bordering on incoherence.",0
"""Then how do you account for the fact that you left the unmistakable impress of your finger-prints on it?” The bullying manner was highly efficacious with a nervous disposition. “I I suppose I must have taken up the bottle.” “I suppose so too! Did you abstract any of the contents of the bottle?” “Certainly not.” “Then why did you take it up?” “I once studied to be a doctor. Such things naturally interest me.” “Ah! So poisons ‘naturally interest’ you, do they? Still, you waited to be alone before gratifying that ‘interest’ of yours?” “That was pure chance.",0
"Still, there it is, we were in the wrong, and now there’s a beastly feeling that one ought to make amends; which is difficult, when one doesn’t like the fellow a bit better than one did before. The whole thing’s damned awkward! And I’m thankful he’s had the tact to take himself off. It’s a good thing Styles wasn’t the mater’s to leave to him. Couldn’t bear to think of the fellow lording it here. He’s welcome to her money.” “You’ll be able to keep up the place all right?” I asked. “Oh, yes.",0
"“No, you are right,” he said, “it is not as though there was a blood tie. She has been kind and generous to these Cavendishes, but she was not their own mother. Blood tells always remember that blood tells.” “Poirot,” I said, “I wish you would tell me why you wanted to know if Mrs.",0
"But more money is essential. No money no results!” Another voice which Tommy rather thought was that of Boris replied: “Will you guarantee that there are results?” “In a month from now sooner or later as you wish I will guarantee you such a reign of terror in Ireland as shall shake the British Empire to its foundations.” There was a pause, and then came the soft, sibilant accents of Number One: “Good! You shall have the money. Boris, you will see to that.” Boris asked a question: “Via the Irish Americans, and Mr.",0
"“We’ve got a deal on with Lord Yardly. There’s some chance of our arranging to film a play down there in his ancestral pile.” “At Yardly Chase?” I cried, interested. “Why, it’s one of the show places of England.” Miss Marvell nodded. “I guess it’s the real old feudal stuff all right. But he wants a pretty stiff price, and of course I don’t know yet whether the deal will go through, but Greg and I always like to combine business with pleasure.",0
"""In the end,” said Colonel Race thoughtfully, “you fall in love and you fall out of it, is that what you mean?” “Not exactly, but you can put it that way if you like.” “But I don’t think you’ve ever fallen out of love, Miss Anne?” “No, I haven’t,” I admitted frankly. “Or fallen in love, either?” I did not answer. The car drew up at our destination and brought the conversation to a close. We got out and began the slow ascent to the World’s View. Not for the first time, I felt a slight discomfort in Colonel Race’s company.",0
"You’re so young, Anne, and so beautiful with the kind of beauty that sends men mad. All the world’s before you love, life, everything. Mine’s behind me scorched, spoiled, with a taste of bitter ashes.” “If you don’t want me” “You know I want you. You know that I’d give my soul to pick you up in my arms and keep you here, hidden away from the world, for ever and ever. And you’re tempting me, Anne. You, with your long witch’s hair, and your eyes that are golden and brown and green and never stop laughing even when your mouth is grave. But I’ll save you from yourself and from me. You shall go to-night.",0
"""Don't let's split hairs,"" I said impatiently. ""You foresaw this?"" ""I did."" ""Why?"" Poirot put his hand into his pocket and pulled out a white bishop. ""Why,"" I cried, ""you forgot to give it back to Dr. Savaronoff."" ""You are in error, my friend. That bishop still reposes in my left-hand pocket. I took its fellow from the box of chessmen Mademoiselle Daviloff kindly permitted me to examine. The plural of one bishop is two bishops."" He sounded the final ""s"" with a great hiss. I was completely mystified.",0
"“Mr. Hersheimmer,” he said at last, “that is a very large sum.” “I guess it’ll have to be. These aren’t the kind of folk to offer sixpence to.” “At the present rate of exchange it amounts to considerably over two hundred and fifty thousand pounds.” “That’s so. Maybe you think I’m talking through my hat, but I can deliver the goods all right, with enough over to spare for your fee.” Sir James flushed slightly. “There is no question of a fee, Mr. Hersheimmer. I am not a private detective.” “Sorry. I guess I was just a mite hasty, but I’ve been feeling bad about this money question.",0
"Shall I demonstrate my methods to you?” “Oh, by all means let us have a demonstration!” Poirot sat very upright and began, wagging his forefinger emphatically to emphasize his points. “I will start as you started from the basic fact of Georges Conneau. Now the story told by Madame Beroldy in court as to the ‘Russians’ was admittedly a fabrication. If she was innocent of connivance in the crime, it was concocted by her, and by her only as she stated. If, on the other hand, she was not innocent, it might have been invented by either her or Georges Conneau. “Now in this case we are investigating, we meet the same tale.",0
"I drew back quickly into the shadow. The man was talking to Guy Pagett. If I had ever had any doubts, that would have settled it. Pagett had his watch out and was looking at it. They exchanged a few brief words, and then the secretary swung on down the street towards the station. Evidently he had given his orders. But what were they? Suddenly my heart leapt into my mouth. The man who had followed me crossed to the middle of the road and spoke to a policeman. He spoke at some length, gesticulating towards Cartwright’s and evidently explaining something. I saw the plan at once. I was to be arrested on some charge or other pocket-picking, perhaps.",0
"Finding that photograph in the drawer, after that story of how it had been got from him by Inspector Brown, made me suspect Julius. Then I remembered that it was Sir James who had discovered the false Jane Finn. In the end, I couldn’t make up my mind and just decided to take no chances either way. I left a note for Julius, in case he was Mr. Brown, saying I was off to the Argentine, and I dropped Sir James’s letter with the offer of the job by the desk so that he would see it was a genuine stunt. Then I wrote my letter to Mr. Carter and rang up Sir James.",0
"Number Two and Number Three are so powerful, so high up, that they are for the present immune from our attacks. Nevertheless what is their safeguard is, by a perverse chance, our safeguard also. They are so much in the limelight that their movements must be carefully ordered. And so we come to the last member of the gang we come to the man known as Number Four."" Poirot's voice altered a little, as it always did when speaking of this particular individual. ""Number Two and Number Three are able to succeed, to go on their way unscathed, owing to their notoriety and their assured position. Number Four succeeds for the opposite reason he succeeds by the way of obscurity.",0
"Dogging ‘Rita’ most likely. By the way, I suppose that’s who Annette meant by Marguerite. I didn’t get it at the time.” The thought saddened him a little, for it seemed to prove that Mrs. Vandemeyer and the girl were on intimate terms. The taxi drew up at the Ritz. Tommy burst into its sacred portals eagerly, but his enthusiasm received a check. He was informed that Miss Cowley had gone out a quarter of an hour ago. BAFFLED for the moment, Tommy strolled into the restaurant, and ordered a meal of surpassing excellence. His four days’ imprisonment had taught him anew to value good food.",0
"Miss Tuppence put me wise to that right away. There’s no humbug about her. We ought to gee along together very well.” Tommy looked at him curiously for a minute, as though he were about to speak, then changed his mind and said nothing. Tuppence and Julius! Well, why not? Had she not lamented the fact that she knew no rich men? Had she not openly avowed her intention of marrying for money if she ever had the chance? Her meeting with the young American millionaire had given her the chance and it was unlikely she would be slow to avail herself of it. She was out for money.",0
"Immediately, with an energy surprising in one of her bulk, Mrs. Opalsen sprang from her chair towards him. “There now; Ed may say what he likes, but I believe in luck, I do. It was fated I should meet you the way I did this evening, and I’ve a feeling that if you can’t get my pearls back for me nobody can.” “Calm yourself, I pray of you, madame.” Poirot patted her hand soothingly. “Reassure yourself. All will be well. Hercule Poirot will aid you!” Mr. Opalsen turned to the police inspector.",0
"to discover what his patient really did die of, but a hæmorrhage seems fairly definite. Still, we can but make some necessary inquiries. Five minutes to pack your bag, Hastings, and we will take a taxi to Liverpool Street.” About an hour later, we alighted from a Great Eastern train at the little station of Marsdon Leigh. Inquiries at the station yielded the information that Marsdon Manor was about a mile distant. Poirot decided to walk, and we betook ourselves along the main street. “What is our plan of campaign?” I asked.",0
"“Answer my question, if you please.” “I suppose,” said Lawrence quietly, “that I should.” “What do you mean by you ‘suppose’? Your brother has no children. You would inherit it, wouldn’t you?” “Yes.” “Ah, that’s better,” said Heavywether, with ferocious geniality. “And you’d inherit a good slice of money too, wouldn’t you?” “Really, Sir Ernest,” protested the judge, “these questions are not relevant.” Sir Ernest bowed, and having shot his arrow proceeded. “On Tuesday, the 17th July, you went, I believe, with another guest, to visit the dispensary at the Red Cross Hospital in Tadminster?” “Yes.",0
"""The matter on which you want to consult him is serious?” “My God, yes! My uncle, the best friend I have in the world, was foully murdered last night.” “Here in London?” “No, in Derbyshire. I was in town and received a telegram from my wife this morning. Immediately upon its receipt I determined to come round and beg Monsieur Poirot to undertake the case.” “If you will excuse me a minute,” I said, struck by a sudden idea. I rushed upstairs, and in a few brief words acquainted Poirot with the situation. He took any further words out of my mouth. “I see. I see. You want to go yourself, is it not so? Well, why not? You should know my methods by now.",0
"Again he ducked, and again the lion sprang right over him. This happened a third time, but by now he was close to the entrance of the tent, and he darted in and seized his rifle. When he emerged, rifle in hand, the lion had disappeared. That puzzled him greatly. He crept round the back of the tent, where there was a little clearing. There, sure enough, was the lion, busily practising low jumps.” This was received with a roar of applause. I drank some champagne. “On another occasion,” I remarked, “this friend of mine had a second curious experience.",0
"Not a doubt of it, she has had her history! She is no longer young, but ma foi! I who speak to you have seen the men’s heads turn after her as she goes down the street. Besides lately, she has had more money to spend all the town knows it. The little economies, they are at an end.” And Françoise shook her head with an air of unalterable certainty. M. Hautet stroked his beard reflectively. “And Madame Renauld?” he asked at length. “How did she take this friendship.” Françoise shrugged her shoulders. “She was always most amiable most polite. One would say that she suspected nothing.",0
"""If it were not for the mal de mer, and the difficulty of practising the so excellent method of Laverguier for a longer time than the few hours of crossing the channel, I should delight to voyage myself on one of these big liners,” murmured Poirot dreamily. “Yes, indeed,” I said enthusiastically. “Some of them must be perfect palaces; the swimming-baths, the lounges, the restaurant, the palm courts really, it must be hard to believe that one is on the sea.” “Me, I always know when I am on the sea,” said Poirot sadly.",0
"A malicious gleam shot through Poirot’s eyes. “If it is information you seek, you need not be at the pains of deranging yourself. I can tell you all you wish to know. The Dulcibella Sisters have cancelled their contract, and have left Coventry for an unknown destination.” “Is that really so, Poirot?” “You can take it from me, Hastings. I made inquiries the first thing this morning. After all, what else did you expect?” True enough, nothing else could be expected under the circumstances. Cinderella had profited by the slight start I had been able to assure her, and would certainly not lose a moment in removing herself from the reach of the pursuer. It was what I had intended and planned.",0
"Just as we were preparing to retire to rest, Sir Guy caught Poirot by the arm and pointed. A shadowy figure was moving amidst the tents. It was no human one: I recognized distinctly the dog-headed figure I had seen carved on the walls of the tomb. My blood literally froze at the sight. “Mon Dieu!” murmured Poirot, crossing himself vigorously. “Anubis, the jackal-headed, the god of departing souls.” “Some one is hoaxing us,” cried Dr. Tosswill, rising indignantly to his feet. “It went into your tent, Harper,” muttered Sir Guy, his face dreadfully pale.",0
" Johannesburg,  March 6th. There is something about the state of things here that is not at all healthy. To use the well-known phrase that I have so often read, we are all living on the edge of a volcano. Bands of strikers, or so-called strikers, patrol the streets and scowl at one in a murderous fashion. They are picking out the bloated capitalists ready for when the massacres begin, I suppose. You can’t ride in a taxi if you do, strikers pull you out again.",0
"""Delightful,” commented Tommy. “Especially coming from a clergyman’s daughter!” “The moral guilt,” Tuppence pointed out, “would be theirs not mine. You must admit that there’s a difference between stealing a diamond necklace for yourself and being hired to steal it.” “There wouldn’t be the least difference if you were caught!” “Perhaps not. But I shouldn’t be caught. I’m so clever.” “Modesty always was your besetting sin,” remarked Tommy. “Don’t rag.",0
"Why could he not have spoken out boldly? Did he fear for this former entanglement of his to come to the ears of Marthe Daubreuil? I shook my head, dissatisfied. The thing had been harmless enough, a foolish boy and girl affair, and I reflected cynically that the son of a millionaire was not likely to be thrown over by a penniless French girl, who moreover loved him devotedly, without a much graver cause. Altogether I found the affair puzzling and unsatisfactory. I disliked intensely being associated with Poirot in hunting this girl down, but I could not see any way of avoiding it, without revealing everything to him, and this, for some reason, I was loath to do.",0
"I agreed that there was much to be said for her view, but I was not entirely satisfied. For in each suspicious instance Pagett had been shown as the directing genius. It was true that his personality seemed to lack the assurance and decision that one would expect from a master criminal but after all, according to Colonel Race, it was brain work only that this mysterious leader supplied, and creative genius is often allied to a weak and timorous physical constitution.",0
"But she is the kind of young woman who does these things. Impossible to withstand her. She is full of coaxing ways that mask an invincible determination. Look how she has got into my private car! I am beginning to have an inkling why. Race said something about the police suspecting that Rayburn would make for Rhodesia. He might just have got off by Monday’s train. They telegraphed all along the line, I presume, and no one of his description was found, but that says little. He’s an astute young man and he knows Africa. He’s probably exquisitely disguised as an old Kafir woman and the simple police continue to look for a handsome young man with a scar, dressed in the height of European fashion.",0
"I congratulated him. The discovery was a providential one. Of course, from the moment that the girl in Manchester was proved to be a plant everything was altered. Young Beresford saw that for himself without my having to tell it him. But he felt he couldn’t trust his judgment on the subject of Miss Cowley. Did I think she was alive? I told him, duly weighing the evidence, that there was a very decided chance in favour of it. That brought us back to the telegram.” “Yes?” “I advised him to apply to you for a copy of the original wire.",0
"They were elicited subsequently at the trial by a process of long and tedious cross-examinations. I received a letter from Evelyn Howard a couple of days after her departure, telling me she was working as a nurse at the big hospital in Middlingham, a manufacturing town some fifteen miles away, and begging me to let her know if Mrs. Inglethorp should show any wish to be reconciled. The only fly in the ointment of my peaceful days was Mrs. Cavendish’s extraordinary, and, for my part, unaccountable preference for the society of Dr. Bauerstein.",0
"He’d balanced the outside stones on them, so that you’d think you were still on the path when in reality you were stepping into nothingness. God help him if I lay my hands upon him!” He paused a minute and then said in a totally different tone: “We’ve never spoken of these things, Anne, have we? But the time’s come. I want you to hear the whole story from the beginning.” “If it hurts you to go over the past, don’t tell me,” I said in a low voice. “But I want you to know. I never thought I should speak of that part of my life to any one. Funny, isn’t it, the tricks Fate plays?” He was silent for a minute or two.",0
"The sheets fell from my hand, and I looked across at him. “Did you know all the time that it was the other?” “Yes, my friend.” “Why did you not tell me?” “To begin with, I could hardly believe it conceivable that you could make such a mistake. You had seen the photograph. The sisters are very alike, but by no means incapable of distinguishment.” “But the fair hair?” “A wig, worn for the sake of a piquant contrast on the stage. Is it conceivable that with twins one should be fair and one dark?” “Why didn’t you tell me that night at the hotel in Coventry?” “You were rather high-handed in your methods, mon ami,” said Poirot dryly. “You did not give me a chance.",0
"I myself had been the first sufferer from the disease. Poirot in his turn had gone down. He was now sitting up in bed, propped up with pillows, his head muffled in a woollen shawl, and was slowly sipping a particularly noxious tisane which I had prepared according to his directions. His eye rested with pleasure upon a neatly graduated row of medicine bottles which adorned the mantelpiece. “Yes, yes,” my little friend continued. “Once more shall I be myself again, the great Hercule Poirot, the terror of evil-doers! Figure to yourself, mon ami, that I have a little paragraph to myself in Society Gossip.",0
"“This is an English friend of mine, Captain Hastings M. Lucien Bex.” The commissary and I bowed to each other ceremoniously, then M. Bex turned once more to Poirot. “Mon vieux, I have not seen you since 1909, that time in Ostend. I heard that you had left the Force?” “So I have. I run a private business in London.” “And you say you have information to give which may assist us?” “Possibly you know it already. You were aware that I had been sent for?” “No. By whom?” “The dead man. It seems he knew an attempt was going to be made on his life. Unfortunately he sent for me too late.” “Sacri tonnerre!” ejaculated the Frenchman.",0
"… She had loved him! Could she let her hand be the one to send him to the Guillotine? She had been guilty of much, but she was innocent of the terrible crime imputed to her. However that may have been, her eloquence and personality won the day. Madame Beroldy, amidst a scene of unparalleled excitement, was acquitted. Despite the utmost endeavours of the police, Georges Conneau was never traced. As for Madame Beroldy, nothing more was heard of her. Taking the child with her, she left Paris to begin a new life. I have set down the Beroldy case in full. Of course all the details did not present themselves to my memory as I have recounted them here.",0
"Some time in the evening she unbolted the door leading into Mademoiselle Cynthia’s room. Possibly she applied oil to the hinges, for I found that it opened quite noiselessly when I tried it. She put off her project until the early hours of the morning as being safer, since the servants were accustomed to hearing her move about her room at that time. She dressed completely in her land kit, and made her way quietly through Mademoiselle Cynthia’s room into that of Mrs. Inglethorp.",0
"Templeton. Quite a pleasant house, and quite pleasant people. The wife, Mrs. Templeton, is much younger than her husband, and he has a son by his first marriage who lives there. I don't know that the young man and the step-mother always get on together. He's not quite what you'd call normal not 'wanting' exactly, but decidedly dull in the intellect. Well, this illness of Mr. Templeton's seemed to me from the first to be very mysterious. At times there seemed really nothing the matter with him, and then he suddenly has one of these gastric attacks with pain and vomiting. But the doctor seemed quite satisfied, and it wasn't for me to say anything.",0
"“Isn’t it yours?” I demanded sweetly. “Or do you prefer to be called ‘The Man in the Brown Suit’?” That did stagger him. He released my arm and fell back a pace or two. “Are you a girl or a witch?” he breathed. “I’m a friend.” I advanced a step towards him. “I offered you my help once I offer it again. Will you have it?” The fierceness of his answer took me aback. “No. I’ll have no truck with you or with any woman. Do your damnedest.” As before, my own temper began to rise.",0
"""And and Poirot?"" ""We will keep him in safe custody until we have concluded our operations. Then we will let him go."" ""Will you swear that also on the tombs of your ancestors?"" ""I have sworn one oath to you. That should be sufficient."" My heart sank. I was betraying my friend to what? For a moment I hesitated then the terrible alternative rose like a nightmare before my eyes. Cinderella in the hands of these Chinese devils, dying by slow torture A groan rose to my lips. I seized the pen. Perhaps by careful wording of the letter, I could convey a warning, and Poirot would be enabled to avoid the trap.",0
"""That will be impossible, I fear,” said Sir James. “It is very unlikely they would allow her to see visitors at this time of night. I should suggest to-morrow morning about ten o’clock.” Julius flushed. There was something in Sir James which always stirred him to antagonism. It was a conflict of two masterful personalities. “All the same, I reckon I’ll go round there to-night and see if I can’t ginger them up to break through their silly rules.” “It will be quite useless, Mr. Hersheimmer.",0
"Flemming and her friends seemed to me to be supremely uninteresting. They talked for hours of themselves and their children and of the difficulties of getting good milk for the children and of what they said to the Dairy when the milk wasn’t good. Then they would go on to servants, and the difficulties of getting good servants and of what they had said to the woman at the Registry Office and of what the woman at the Registry Office had said to them. They never seemed to read the papers or to care about what went on in the world. They disliked travelling everything was so different to England.",0
"Une poignee de main, alors.” I felt rather at a loose end after Poirot had left me. I strolled down the beach, and watched the bathers, without feeling energetic enough to join them. I rather fancied that Cinderella might be disporting herself amongst them in some wonderful costume, but I saw no signs of her. I strolled aimlessly along the sands towards the further end of the town. It occurred to me that, after all, it would only be decent feeling on my part to inquire after the girl. And it would save trouble in the end.",0
"That man is not Hercule Poirot!"" Number Four uttered an incredulous exclamation, but the countess leant forward and snatched at Poirot's moustaches. They came off in her hand, and then, indeed, the truth was plain. For this man's upper lip was disfigured by a small scar which completely altered the expression of the face. ""Not Hercule Poirot,"" muttered Number Four. ""But who can he be then?"" ""I know,"" I cried suddenly, and then stopped dead, afraid I had ruined everything. But the man I will still refer to as Poirot had turned to me encouragingly.",0
"It seems that all along she’s been on the track of “The Man in the Brown Suit.” Apparently she didn’t spot him on the Kilmorden_ in fact, she hardly had the chance, but she’s now very busy cabling home: “How I journeyed out with the Murderer,” and inventing highly fictitious stories of “What he said to me,” etc. I know how these things are done. I do them myself, in my Reminiscences when Pagett will let me. And of course one of Nasby’s efficient staff will brighten up the details still more, so that when it appears in the Daily Budget Rayburn won’t recognize himself.",0
"“But there’s a gentleman about who’s rather drunk, and we are afraid he might get into one of the ladies’ cabins and frighten them.” “How dreadful,” I said, looking alarmed. “He won’t come in here, will he?” “Oh, I don’t think so, miss. Ring the bell if he does. Good night.” “Good night.” I opened the door and peeped down the corridor. Except for the retreating form of the stewardess, there was nobody in sight. Drunk! So that was the explanation of it. My histrionic talents had been wasted.",0
"…” I did not hear young Renauld’s answer, for my attention was distracted by an unusual appearance a little further down the hedge. There appeared to be a brown bush there, which seemed odd, to say the least of it, so early in the summer. I stepped along to investigate, but, at my advance, the brown bush withdrew itself precipitately, and faced me with a finger to its lips. It was Giraud. Enjoining caution, he led the way round the shed until we were out of ear-shot. “What were you doing there?” I asked. “Exactly what you were doing listening.” “But I was not there on purpose!” “Ah!” said Giraud.",0
"I arranged it all so carefully too, sending him off to Florence, telling the hotel I was going over to Nice for one night or possibly two. Then, by the time the murder was discovered, I was back again in Cannes, with nobody dreaming that I’d ever left the Riviera.” He still spoke quite naturally and unaffectedly. I had to pinch myself to understand that this was all real that the man in front of me was really that deep-dyed criminal, the “Colonel.” I followed things out in my mind.",0
"""I wish I could remember about the window,"" he said frankly. ""But it's dangerous to think back, one becomes quite positive about something that never existed. That's psychology, isn't it, M. Poirot? You see, I've read all about your methods, and I may say I'm an enormous admirer of yours. No, I suppose it's pretty certain that the Chinaman put the powdered opium in the curry, but he'll never admit it, and we shall never know why. But holding a man down in a fire that's not in keeping with our Chinese friend's character, it seems to me.",0
"I’m going to ask you not to open it until the very last moment, midnight on the 28th, in fact. You’ll understand why in a minute. You see, I’ve figured it out that those things of Tuppence’s are a plant too, and she’s no more drowned than I am. The way I reason is this: as a last chance they’ll let Jane Finn escape in the hope that she’s been shamming this memory stunt, and that once she thinks she’s free she’ll go right away to the cache. Of course it’s an awful risk for them to take, because she knows all about them but they’re pretty desperate to get hold of that treaty.",0
"""Is that a likely thing to happen?” “Very. My husband was the most absent-minded of men.” There was a slight frown on her brow as she spoke, as though this trait in the dead man’s character had at times vexed her. “There is one inference I think we might draw,” remarked the commissary suddenly. “Since the men insisted on M. Renauld dressing himself, it looks as though the place they were taking him to, the place where ‘the secret’ was concealed, lay some distance away.” The magistrate nodded. “Yes, far, and yet not too far, since he spoke of being back by morning.",0
"For Poirot, uttering a hoarse and inarticulate cry, again annihilated his masterpiece of cards, and putting his hands over his eyes swayed backwards and forwards, apparently suffering the keenest agony. “Good heavens, Poirot!” I cried. “What is the matter? Are you taken ill?” “No, no,” he gasped. “It is it is that I have an idea!” “Oh!” I exclaimed, much relieved. “One of your ‘little ideas’?” “Ah, ma foi, no!” replied Poirot frankly.",0
"“What about that crevice there?” Julius replied in an awestricken voice: “That’s it for sure.” They looked at each other. “When I was in France,” said Tommy reminiscently, “whenever my batman failed to call me, he always said that he had come over queer. I never believed it. But whether he felt it or not, there is such a sensation. I’ve got it now! Badly!” He looked at the rock with a kind of agonized passion. “Damn it!” he cried.",0
"""Well, we have. Tell me something about yourself.” “I’m an actress. No not the kind you’re thinking of, lunching at the Savoy covered with jewellery, and with their photograph in every paper saying how much they love Madame So and So’s face cream. I’ve been on the boards since I was a kid of six tumbling.” “I beg your pardon,” I said puzzled. “Haven’t you seen child acrobats?” “Oh, I understand.” “I’m American born, but I’ve spent most of my life in England. We got a new show now ” “We?” “My sister and I. Sort of song and dance, and a bit of patter, and a dash of the old business thrown in.",0
"When I came to think of it, would any one, writing down a date, think it necessary to put the year as well as the month? Supposing 17 meant Cabin 17? And 1? The time one o’clock. Then 22 must be the date. I looked up at my little almanac. To-morrow was the 22nd! I was violently excited. I was sure that I had hit on the right trail at last. One thing was clear, I must not move out of the cabin. The asafœtida had got to be borne. I examined my facts again. To-morrow was the 22nd, and at 1 a.m. or 1 p.m. something would happen. I plumped for 1 a.m. It was now seven o’clock. In six hours I should know. I don’t know how I got through the evening.",0
"Annette told me how you’d escaped. Buck up. “Yours, “TWOPENCE.” Tommy raised a shout for Albert before he had even finished perusing this characteristic epistle. “Pack my bag! We’re off!” “Yes, sir.” The boots of Albert could be heard racing upstairs. Holyhead? Did that mean that, after all Tommy was puzzled. He read on slowly. The boots of Albert continued to be active on the floor above. Suddenly a second shout came from below. “Albert! I’m a damned fool! Unpack that bag!” “Yes, sir.” Tommy smoothed out the note thoughtfully. “Yes, a damned fool,” he said softly.",0
"But at last I see clearly.” “You know everything?” “I have discovered what M. Renauld sent for me to discover.” “And you know the murderer?” “I know one murderer.” “What do you mean?” “We talk a little at cross-purposes. There are here not one crime, but two. The first I have solved, the second eh bien, I will confess, I am not sure!” “But, Poirot, I thought you said the man in the shed had died a natural death?” “Ta-ta-ta.” Poirot made his favourite ejaculation of impatience. “Still you do not understand. One may have a crime without a murderer, but for two crimes it is essential to have two bodies.",0
"“You see, I was right!” “My dear Boris, can you not take a joke?” “Was it a joke?” “Of course.” “Then all I can say is that your ideas of humour are peculiar, my dear Rita.” Mrs. Vandemeyer smiled. “Let us not quarrel, Boris. Touch the bell. We will have some drinks.” Tuppence beat a hasty retreat. She paused a moment to survey herself in Mrs. Vandemeyer’s long glass, and be sure that nothing was amiss with her appearance. Then she answered the bell demurely.",0
"I can’t help thinking that I’m really rather clever! How that other taxi man will swear! But I took his number, and I’ll send him a postal order to-morrow, so that he won’t lose by it if he happens to be genuine. What’s this thing swerving Oh!” There was a grinding noise and a bump. Another taxi had collided with them. In a flash Tuppence was out on the pavement. A policeman was approaching. Before he arrived Tuppence had handed the driver five shillings, and she and Jane had merged themselves in the crowd. “It’s only a step or two now,” said Tuppence breathlessly.",0
"But perhaps you’d like to know what I was doing in your garden?’ ‘I think the facts do call for an explanation,’ he replied. ‘Well, to begin with, I wasn’t after the spoons.’ “He smiled. ‘My first theory. But I soon altered my mind. By the way, you are an American, are you not?’ I told him my name. ‘And you?’ ‘I am Dr. Hall, and this, as you doubtless know, is my private nursing home.’ “I didn’t know, but I wasn’t going to put him wise. I was just thankful for the information. I liked the man, and I felt he was straight, but I wasn’t going to give him the whole story.",0
"Cinderella kidnapped! In the hands of the infamous Big Four! God, what could I do? Poirot! I must have Poirot. He would advise me. He would checkmate them somehow. In a few minutes now, he would be back. I must wait patiently until then. But Cinderella in the hands of the Big Four! Another knock. Mrs. Pearson put her head in once more. ""A note for you, captain brought by a heathen Chinaman. He's a-waiting downstairs."" I seized it from her. It was brief and to the point. ""If you ever wish to see your wife again, go with the bearer of this note immediately.",0
"Ever heard of land slides? There was one about here two years ago. There's going to be another to-night. I've fixed that good and square. Say, that friend of yours doesn't keep his dates very punctually."" A wave of horror swept over me. Poirot! In another minute he would walk straight into the trap. And I was powerless to warn him. I could only pray that he had elected to leave the matter in my hands, and had remained in London. Surely, if he had been coming, he would have been here by now. With every minute that passed, my hopes rose. Suddenly they were dashed to pieces.",0
"What was this complication of a will? Who had destroyed it? The person who had left the candle grease on the floor? Obviously. But how had anyone gained admission? All the doors had been bolted on the inside. “Now, my friend,” said Poirot briskly, “we will go. I should like to ask a few questions of the parlourmaid Dorcas, her name is, is it not?” We passed through Alfred Inglethorp’s room, and Poirot delayed long enough to make a brief but fairly comprehensive examination of it. We went out through that door, locking both it and that of Mrs. Inglethorp’s room as before.",0
"""Had he any reason to believe that you and I might be friendly with each other?” “He might have had,” I answered thoughtfully, remembering our conversation on the way back from the Matoppos. “He’s a very powerful personality,” I continued, “but not at all my idea of the ‘Colonel.’ And, anyway, such an idea would be absurd. He’s in the Secret Service.” “How do we know that he is? It’s the easiest thing in the world to throw out a hint of that kind. No one contradicts it, and the rumour spreads until every one believes it as gospel truth. It provides an excuse for all sorts of doubtful doings. Anne, do you like Race?” “I do and I don’t.",0
"As we went up the stairs, John looked back to the dining-room door, and lowered his voice confidentially: “Look here, what’s going to happen when these two meet?” I shook my head helplessly. “I’ve told Mary to keep them apart if she can.” “Will she be able to do so?” “The Lord only knows. There’s one thing, Inglethorp himself won’t be too keen on meeting her.” “You’ve got the keys still, haven’t you, Poirot?” I asked, as we reached the door of the locked room. Taking the keys from Poirot, John unlocked it, and we all passed in. The lawyer went straight to the desk, and John followed him.",0
"It had begun like a page of romance. Now, shorn of its glamour, it seemed to be turning to grim reality. Tommy that was all that mattered. Many times in the day Tuppence blinked the tears out of her eyes resolutely. “Little fool,” she would apostrophize herself, “don’t snivel. Of course you’re fond of him. You’ve known him all your life. But there’s no need to be sentimental about it.” In the meantime, nothing more was seen of Boris. He did not come to the flat, and Julius and the car waited in vain. Tuppence gave herself over to new meditations.",0
"We had finished dinner, and were sitting over our coffee and cigarettes.” “Your husband had already left for London?” “Yes, he went up by the 6.15.” “Did he go by car to the station, or did he walk?” “Our own car isn’t down here. One came out from the garage in Elmer’s Dale to fetch him in time for the train.” “Was Mr. Pace quite his usual self?” “Absolutely. Most normal in every way.” “Now, can you describe this visitor at all?” “I’m afraid not. I didn’t see him. Mrs. Middleton showed him straight into the gun-room and then came to tell my uncle.",0
"“Excuse me, Hastings, I must take a short stroll.” When he returned, about an hour later, his eyes were gleaming with a peculiar excitement. He laid his stick on the table, and brushed the nap of his hat with his usual tender care before he spoke. “It is as well, mon ami, that we have no affairs of moment on hand. We can devote ourselves wholly to the present investigation.” “What investigation are you talking about?” “The remarkable cheapness of your friend’s, Mrs. Robinson’s, new flat.” “Poirot, you are not serious!” “I am most serious.",0
"“It’s likely, isn’t it, then there would be two girls with a name like that?” “Or I might just have hit upon it by chance,” continued Tuppence, intoxicated with the success of truthfulness. Mr. Whittington brought his fist down upon the desk with a bang. “Quit fooling! How much do you know? And how much do you want?” The last five words took Tuppence’s fancy mightily, especially after a meagre breakfast and a supper of buns the night before. Her present part was of the adventuress rather than the adventurous order, but she did not deny its possibilities.",0
"‘Implicated in the most thrilling mystery please send me a thousand pounds at once Suzanne.’” I took the form from her, and pointed out that she could eliminate a “the,” an “a,” and possibly, if she didn’t care about being polite, a “please.” Suzanne, however, appears to be perfectly reckless in money matters. Instead of attending to my economical suggestions, she added three words more: “enjoying myself hugely.” Suzanne was engaged to lunch with friends of hers, who came to the hotel about eleven o’clock to fetch her. I was left to my own devices.",0
"She and Carton were to have met there, they both had an order to view the same house, and if they took such elaborate precautions to make their meeting appear accidental they must have suspected they were being followed. All the same, Carton did not know that his shadower was the ‘Man in the Brown Suit.’ When he recognized him, the shock was so great that he lost his head completely and stepped back onto the line. That all seems pretty clear, don’t you think so, Anne?” I did not reply. “Yes, that’s how it was. He took the paper from the dead man, and in his hurry to get away he dropped it. Then he followed the woman to Marlow.",0
"” This was so typical of Japp, that I could not forbear a chuckle. Poirot continued to read his correspondence placidly. “A suggestion that I should give a lecture to our local boy scouts. The Countess of Forfanock will be obliged if I will call and see her. Another lap-dog without doubt! And now for the last. Ah ” I looked up, quick to notice the change of tone. Poirot was reading attentively. In a minute he tossed the sheet over to me. “This is out of the ordinary, mon ami. Read for yourself.",0
"“No sugar,” said Cynthia, watching him, as he picked up the sugar-tongs. “No sugar? You abandon it in the war-time, eh?” “No, I never take it in coffee.” “Sacré!” murmured Poirot to himself, as he brought back the replenished cup. Only I heard him, and glancing up curiously at the little man I saw that his face was working with suppressed excitement, and his eyes were as green as a cat’s.",0
"""So, as far as you know, he had no enemies, and you can give us no clue as to any secret to obtain possession of which he might have been murdered?” “That’s so.” “M. Stonor, have you ever heard the name of Duveen in connection with M. Renauld?” “Duveen. Duveen.” He tried the name over thoughtfully. “I don’t think I have. And yet it seems familiar.” “Do you know a lady, a friend of M. Renauld’s whose Christian name is Bella?” Again Mr. Stonor shook his head. “Bella Duveen? Is that the full name? It’s curious! I’m sure I know it. But for the moment I can’t remember in what connection.",0
"Though familiar with the technicalities from a course of novel reading, he had never before attempted to “follow” anyone, and it appeared to him at once that, in actual practice, the proceeding was fraught with difficulties. Supposing, for instance, that they should suddenly hail a taxi? In books, you simply leapt into another, promised the driver a sovereign or its modern equivalent and there you were. In actual fact, Tommy foresaw that it was extremely likely there would be no second taxi. Therefore he would have to run.",0
"“Nothing more you can tell us about him?” he demanded, as I rose to depart. “Yes,” I said. I seized my opportunity to fire a parting shot. “His head was markedly brachycephalic. He will not find it so easy to alter that.” I observed with pleasure that Inspector Meadow’s pen wavered. It was clear that he did not know how to spell brachycephalic. In the first heat of indignation I found my next step unexpectedly easy to tackle. I had had a half-formed plan in my head when I went into Scotland Yard.",0
"” I mused, thinking over the new field of conjecture that Poirot’s deductions had opened up to me. I recalled my wonder at his cryptic allusions to the flower bed and the wrist watch. His remarks had seemed so meaningless at the moment and now, for the first time, I realized how remarkably, from a few slight incidents, he had unravelled much of the mystery that surrounded the case. I paid a belated homage to my friend. As though he read my thoughts, he nodded sagely. “Method, you comprehend! Method! Arrange your facts. Arrange your ideas. And if some little fact will not fit in do not reject it but consider it closely.",0
"He was not nearly so sunburnt as the others, and that fact, coupled with a certain haggardness round the eyes, made him look older than his twenty-two years. He was clearly endeavouring to bear up under a severe mental strain. He introduced his two companions, Dr. Ames, a capable looking man of thirty odd, with a touch of greying hair at the temples, and Mr. Harper, the secretary, a pleasant lean young man wearing the national insignia of horn-rimmed spectacles. After a few minutes’ desultory conversation the latter went out, and Dr. Tosswill followed him. We were left alone with Sir Guy and Dr. Ames.",0
"Is not that a beautiful and consoling thought? Yes, you may leave the room now. But be careful be very careful. IAh, he is gone! And my friend Hastings looks at me with eyes of reproach. But it was all so simple! It was clear, from the first, that out of several hundred, probably, applicants for No. 4, Montagu Mansions only the Robinsons were considered suitable. Why? What was there that singled them out from the rest at practically a glance. Their appearance? Possibly, but it was not so unusual. Their name, then!” “But there’s nothing unusual about the name of Robinson,” I cried.",0
"He did not seem to have heard her, for without a word he turned on his heel and went out of the house. I suggested a quick game of tennis before supper and, Cynthia agreeing, I ran upstairs to fetch my racquet. Mrs. Cavendish was coming down the stairs. It may have been my fancy, but she, too, was looking odd and disturbed. “Had a good walk with Dr. Bauerstein?” I asked, trying to appear as indifferent as I could. “I didn’t go,” she replied abruptly. “Where is Mrs. Inglethorp?” “In the boudoir.",0
"It was one Tommy would have recognized anywhere! Tuppence was in that house! He clutched Albert by the shoulder. “Stay here! When I begin to sing, watch that window.” He retreated hastily to a position on the main drive, and began in a deep roar, coupled with an unsteady gait, the following ditty: I am a Soldier A jolly British Soldier; You can see that I’m a Soldier by my feet It had been a favourite on the gramophone in Tuppence’s hospital days. He did not doubt but that she would recognize it and draw her own conclusions. Tommy had not a note of music in his voice, but his lungs were excellent.",0
"I was trying to decide whether or not I would clear John Cavendish at once. I could have cleared him though it might have meant a failure to convict the real criminals. They were entirely in the dark as to my real attitude up to the very last moment which partly accounts for my success.” “Do you mean that you could have saved John Cavendish from being brought to trial?” “Yes, my friend. But I eventually decided in favour of ‘a woman’s happiness’. Nothing but the great danger through which they have passed could have brought these two proud souls together again.” I looked at Poirot in silent amazement.",0
"Yes, but for my quick eyes, the eyes of a cat, Hercule Poirot might now be crushed out of existence a terrible calamity for the world. And you, too, mon ami though that would not be such a national catastrophe."" ""Thank you,"" I said coldly. ""And what are we going to do now?"" ""Do?"" cried Poirot. ""We are going to think. Yes, here and now, we are going to exercise our little gray cells. This M. Halliday now, was he really in Paris? Yes, for Professor Bourgoneau, who knows him, saw and spoke to him."" ""What on earth are you driving at?"" I cried. ""That was Friday morning.",0
"I don’t like him we don’t gee together somehow but he’s pretty cute, and I guess he wouldn’t quit if there was any chance of success now, would he?” Tuppence felt rather uncomfortable, but clinging to her belief that Julius also had withheld something from her, she remained firm. “He suggested advertising for the nurse,” she reminded him. “Yes, with a ‘forlorn hope’ flavour to his voice! No I’m about fed up. I’ve half a mind to go back to the States right away.” “Oh no!” cried Tuppence. “We’ve got to find Tommy.” “I sure forgot Beresford,” said Julius contritely.",0
"Don’t you bother about anything. Mr. Poirot, here, will show me the way.” As they all went out of the room, Poirot turned and made me a sign to follow him upstairs. There he caught me by the arm, and drew me aside. “Quick, go to the other wing. Stand there just this side of the baize door. Do not move till I come.” Then, turning rapidly, he rejoined the two detectives. I followed his instructions, taking up my position by the baize door, and wondering what on earth lay behind the request.",0
"“Quite right, monsieur. You understand that, if I had thought I would do my husband any good by revealing these facts, I would have done so. But it did not seem to me to bear upon the question of his guilt or innocence.” “In a sense, that is correct, madame. But it cleared my mind of many misconceptions, and left me free to see other facts in their true significance.” “The will!” cried Lawrence. “Then it was you, Mary, who destroyed the will?” She shook her head, and Poirot shook his also. “No,” he said quietly. “There is only one person who could possibly have destroyed that will Mrs.",0
"I was in a strange bed and a strange room. Some one was sitting by the window. He turned and came and stood by me. It was Achille Poirot or, stay, was it The well-known ironical voice dispelled any doubts I might have had. ""But yes, my friend, it is I. Brother Achille has gone home again to the land of myths. It was I all the time. It is not only Number Four who can act a part. Belladona in the eyes, the sacrifice of the moustaches, and a real scar the inflicting of which caused me much pain two months ago but I could not risk a fake beneath the eagle eyes of Number Four.",0
"""I did, but it contains no information. It is merely a note asking me to call upon her this morning, as she wanted my advice on a matter of great importance.” “She gave you no hint as to what that matter might be?” “Unfortunately, no.” “That is a pity,” said John. “A great pity,” agreed Poirot gravely. There was silence. Poirot remained lost in thought for a few minutes. Finally he turned to the lawyer again. “Mr. Wells, there is one thing I should like to ask you that is, if it is not against professional etiquette. In the event of Mrs.",0
"A big chintz-covered settee ran along the opposite wall, and the deep low window seats were covered with the same faded chintz of an old-fashioned pattern. “Eh bien, mon ami,” said Poirot, lighting one of his tiny cigarettes, “we must map out our plan of campaign. Already I have made a rough survey of the house, but I am of opinion that any clue will be found in this room. We shall have to go through the documents in the desk with meticulous care. Naturally, I do not expect to find the will amongst them; but it is likely that some apparently innocent paper may conceal the clue to its hiding-place.",0
"The square was deserted. In front of the house was a baker’s van. Evidently he was to have been taken out of London in that, and his body found many miles from the house in Soho. The driver jumped to the pavement and tried to bar Tommy’s way. Again Tommy’s fist shot out, and the driver sprawled on the pavement. Tommy took to his heels and ran none too soon. The front door opened and a hail of bullets followed him. Fortunately none of them hit him. He turned the corner of the square. “There’s one thing,” he thought to himself, “they can’t go on shooting. They’ll have the police after them if they do.",0
"le juge.” “You know?” “Certainly I know. The subject of the quarrel was Mademoiselle Marthe Daubreuil.” Renauld sprang round, startled. The magistrate leaned forward. “Is this so, monsieur.” Jack Renauld bowed his head. “Yes,” he admitted. “I love Mademoiselle Daubreuil, and I wish to marry her. When I informed my father of the fact, he flew at once into a violent rage. Naturally I could not stand hearing the girl I loved insulted, and I, too, lost my temper.” M. Hautet looked across at Mrs. Renauld. “You were aware of this attachment, madame.",0
"“First I will call upon the doctor. I have ascertained that there is only one doctor in Marsdon Leigh, Dr. Ralph Bernard. Ah, here we are at his house.” The house in question was a kind of superior cottage, standing back a little from the road. A brass plate on the gate bore the doctor’s name. We passed up the path and rang the bell. We proved to be fortunate in our call. It was the doctor’s consulting hour, and for the moment there were no patients waiting for him. Dr. Bernard was an elderly man, high-shouldered and stooping, with a pleasant vagueness of manner. Poirot introduced himself and explained the purpose of our visit, adding that Insurance Companies were bound to investigate fully in a case of this kind.",0
"""By the way,” said Poirot, as though struck by an afterthought, “M. Stonor has not been in Merlinville today, has he?” I could not at all fathom the point of this question which I well knew to be meaningless as far as Poirot was concerned. Madame Daubreuil replied quite composedly: “Not that I know of.” “He has not had an interview with Mrs. Renauld?” “How should I know that, monsieur?” “True,” said Poirot. “I thought you might have seen him coming or going, that is all. Good night, madame.” “Why ” I began. “No ‘whys,’ Hastings. There will be time for that later.",0
"""What will happen now?"" I asked. ""What can happen? He recognises the only man he fears, miraculously resurrected from the dead, at the very minute when the plans of the Big Four are in the balance. Madame Olivier and Abe Ryland lunched here to-day, and it is thought that they went to Cortina. Only we know that they have retired to their hiding place. How much do we know? That is what Number Four is asking himself at this minute. He dare take no risks. I must be suppressed at all costs. Eh bien, let him try to suppress Hercule Poirot! I shall be ready for him."" As he finished speaking, the man at the next table got up and went out.",0
"Almost as though she got a sudden warning to go from some one.” “Mr. Brown, I suppose,” said Julius scoffingly. The lawyer looked at him deliberately for a minute or two. “Why not?” he said. “Remember, you yourself have once been worsted by him.” Julius flushed with vexation. “I feel just mad when I think of how I handed out Jane’s photograph to him like a lamb. Gee, if I ever lay hands on it again, I’ll freeze on to it like like hell!” “That contingency is likely to be a remote one,” said the other dryly. “I guess you’re right,” said Julius frankly. “And, in any case, it’s the original I’m out after.",0
"“I said to him that Lady Yardly had told her husband all, that I was empowered to recover the jewel, and that if it were not immediately handed over proceedings would be taken. Also a few more little lies which occurred to me. He was as wax in my hands!” I pondered the matter. “It seems a little unfair on Mary Marvell. She has lost her diamond through no fault of her own.” “Bah!” said Poirot brutally. “She has a magnificent advertisement. That is all she cares for, that one! Now the other, she is different. Bonne mère, très femme!” “Yes,” I said doubtfully, hardly sharing Poirot’s views on femininity. “I suppose it was Rolf who sent her the duplicate letters.",0
"Tuppence withdrew to a suitable spot. A slatternly looking servant, with an extremely dirty face and a pair of eyes that did not match, answered the door. Tommy had produced a notebook and pencil. “Good morning,” he said briskly and cheerfully. “From the Hampstead Borough Council. The new Voting Register. Mrs. Edgar Keith lives here, does she not?” “Yaas,” said the servant. “Christian name?” asked Tommy, his pencil poised. “Missus’s? Eleanor Jane.” “Eleanor,” spelt Tommy. “Any sons or daughters over twenty-one?” “Naow.” “Thank you.” Tommy closed the notebook with a brisk snap. “Good morning.",0
"A case of quite another description was waiting for us. Our landlady, Mrs. Pearson, at once informed us that a hospital nurse had called and was waiting to see Poirot. We found her sitting in the big arm-chair facing the window, a pleasant-faced woman of middle age, in a dark blue uniform. She was a little reluctant to come to the point, but Poirot soon put her at her ease, and she embarked upon her story. ""You see, M. Poirot, I've never come across anything of the kind before. I was sent for, from the Lark Sisterhood, to go down to a case in Hertfordshire. An old gentleman, it is, Mr.",0
"“I cannot congratulate you upon your manners,” I said coldly. “I can at least relieve you of my presence.” He started for the door, but reeled as he did so. With an abrupt movement I pushed him down upon the sofa. “Don’t be a fool,” I said unceremoniously. “You don’t want to go bleeding all over the ship, do you?” He seemed to see the sense of that, for he sat quietly whilst I bandaged up the wound as best I could. “There,” I said, bestowing a pat on my handiwork, “that will have to do for the present.",0
"” Then she tried again. Tuppence bent lower still. It was only a breath. “Mr. Brown ” The voice stopped. But the half-closed eyes seemed still to send an agonized message. Moved by a sudden impulse, the girl said quickly: “I shan’t leave the flat. I shall sit up all night.” A flash of relief showed before the lids descended once more. Apparently Mrs. Vandemeyer slept. But her words had awakened a new uneasiness in Tuppence. What had she meant by that low murmur: “Mr. Brown?” Tuppence caught herself nervously looking over her shoulder. The big wardrobe loomed up in a sinister fashion before her eyes.",0
""" On arrival in Paris, we drove across to the Gare de l'Est, and Poirot at last announced our destination. We were bound for Bolzano and Italian Tyrol. During Harvey's absence from our carriage I took the opportunity of asking Poirot why he had said that the discovery of the rendezvous was my work. ""Because it was, my friend. How Ingles managed to get hold of the information I do not know, but he did, and he sent it to us by his servant. We are bound, mon ami for Karersee, the new Italian name for which is Lago di Carezza.",0
"As we entered the large hall, John beckoned us both into the smoking-room. I saw at once by his face that something disturbing had occurred. We followed him in, and he shut the door after us. “Look here, Mary, there’s the deuce of a mess. Evie’s had a row with Alfred Inglethorp, and she’s off.” “Evie? Off?” John nodded gloomily. “Yes; you see she went to the mater, and Oh, here’s Evie herself.” Miss Howard entered. Her lips were set grimly together, and she carried a small suit-case. She looked excited and determined, and slightly on the defensive. “At any rate,” she burst out, “I’ve spoken my mind!” “My dear Evelyn,” cried Mrs.",0
"How you ever came to think of it all so pat beats me to a frazzle!” “I was in such a funk I had to think of something,” said Tommy simply. There was a moment’s pause, and then Tommy reverted to Mrs. Vandemeyer’s death. “There’s no doubt it was chloral?” “I believe not. At least they call it heart failure induced by an overdose, or some such claptrap. It’s all right. We don’t want to be worried with an inquest. But I guess Tuppence and I and even the highbrow Sir James have all got the same idea.” “Mr. Brown?” hazarded Tommy. “Sure thing.” Tommy nodded. “All the same,” he said thoughtfully, “Mr. Brown hasn’t got wings. I don’t see how he got in and out.",0
"I took a little from the bottom of the bowl afterwards, and have brought it up with me. I have been spared for the day to visit a sick mother, as Mr. Templeton was well enough to be left."" She drew out a little bottle of dark fluid and handed it to Poirot. ""Excellent, mademoiselle. We will have this analysed immediately. If you will return here in, say, an hour's time I think that we shall be able to dispose of your suspicions one way or another."" First extracting from our visitor her name and qualifications, he ushered her out. Then he wrote a note and sent it off together with the bottle of soup.",0
"It was this room which he had been directed to enter. But what held his glance fascinated was a small recess immediately on his right, half concealed by a torn velvet curtain. It was directly opposite the left-handed door and, owing to its angle, it also commanded a good view of the upper part of the staircase. As a hiding-place for one or, at a pinch, two men, it was ideal, being about two feet deep and three feet wide. It attracted Tommy mightily. He thought things over in his usual slow and steady way, deciding that the mention of “Mr. Brown” was not a request for an individual, but in all probability a password used by the gang. His lucky use of it had gained him admission.",0
"No one can possibly bring home the crime to me. That idea of yours about the bromides was a stroke of genius! But we must be very circumspect. A false step ’ “Here, my friends, the letter breaks off. Doubtless the writer was interrupted; but there can be no question as to his identity. We all know this hand-writing and ” A howl that was almost a scream broke the silence. “You devil! How did you get it?” A chair was overturned. Poirot skipped nimbly aside. A quick movement on his part, and his assailant fell with a crash.",0
"On the outskirts of it, they met a workman swinging his bag of tools, and Tommy stopped him with a question. “The Moat House? It’s empty. Been empty for years. Mrs. Sweeny’s got the key if you want to go over it next to the post office.” Tommy thanked him. They soon found the post office, which was also a sweet and general fancy shop, and knocked at the door of the cottage next to it. A clean, wholesome-looking woman opened it. She readily produced the key of the Moat House. “Though I doubt if it’s the kind of place to suit you, sir. In a terrible state of repair. Ceilings leaking and all.",0
"""Do you also deny this?” The Coroner handed him the register in which his signature was inscribed. “Certainly I do. The hand-writing is quite different from mine. I will show you.” He took an old envelope out of his pocket, and wrote his name on it, handing it to the jury. It was certainly utterly dissimilar. “Then what is your explanation of Mr. Mace’s statement?” Alfred Inglethorp replied imperturbably: “Mr. Mace must have been mistaken.” The Coroner hesitated for a moment, and then said: “Mr. Inglethorp, as a mere matter of form, would you mind telling us where you were on the evening of Monday, July 16th?” “Really I cannot remember.” “That is absurd, Mr.",0
"Then his face changed, and with a long convulsive shudder he fell forward in a crumpled heap, whilst an odour of bitter almonds filled the air. THE supper party given by Mr. Julius Hersheimmer to a few friends on the evening of the 30th will long be remembered in catering circles. It took place in a private room, and Mr. Hersheimmer’s orders were brief and forcible. He gave carte blanche and when a millionaire gives carte blanche he usually gets it! Every delicacy out of season was duly provided. Waiters carried bottles of ancient and royal vintage with loving care.",0
"Having thanked Hassan and refused his offer of another cup for myself, we were left alone once more. I stood at the door of the tent some time after undressing, looking out over the desert. “A wonderful place,” I said aloud, “and a wonderful work. I can feel the fascination. This desert life, this probing into the heart of a vanished civilization. Surely, Poirot, you, too, must feel the charm?” I got no answer, and I turned, a little annoyed. My annoyance was quickly changed to concern. Poirot was lying back across the rude couch, his face horribly convulsed.",0
"Do you think I want to put frocks on you? I’m a damned sight more likely to want to tear them off you. I’m not going to let you go, do you hear? You’re my woman. If I let you go away, I may lose you. I’m never sure of you. You’re coming with me now to-night and damn everybody.” He held me to him, kissing me until I could hardly breathe. “I can’t do without you any longer, Anne. I can’t indeed. I hate all this money. Let Race have it. Come on. Let’s go.” “My toothbrush?” I demurred. “You can buy one. I know I’m a lunatic, but for God’s sake, come!” He stalked off at a furious pace.",0
"I felt an unpleasant sensation down my spine. Were they going to bundle us into it, and leave us there to asphyxiate slowly? However, to my amazement, I saw that from the inside of the safe steps led down beneath the floor. We were thrust down this narrow way and eventually came out into a big subterranean chamber. A woman stood there, tall and imposing, with a black velvet mask covering her face. She was clearly in command of the situation by her gestures of authority. The men slung us down on the floor and left us alone with the mysterious creature in the mask. I had no doubt who she was.",0
"I had always vaguely associated it with a hula-hula, which, I believe, though I may be wrong, is a kind of straw skirt that Hawaiian girls dance in. No, I think I am wrong that is a lava-lava. At any rate, all these things are very cheering after England. I can’t help thinking that it would brighten our cold Island life if one could have a breakfast of bacon-bacon, and then go out clad in a jumper-jumper to pay the books. Suzanne was a little tamer after breakfast. They had given me a room next to hers with a lovely view right out over Table Bay. I looked at the view whilst Suzanne hunted for some special face-cream. When she had found it and started an immediate application, she became capable of listening to me.",0
"“Stole ’em yourself, and want to put it on me. Why, I was only in the room about three minutes before the lady come up, and then you were sitting here the whole time, as you always do, like a cat watching a mouse.” The inspector looked across inquiringly at Célestine. “Is that true? Didn’t you leave the room at all?” “I did not actually leave her alone,” admitted Célestine reluctantly, “but I went into my own room through the door here twice once to fetch a reel of cotton, and once for my scissors. She must have done it then.” “You wasn’t gone a minute,” retorted the chambermaid angrily. “Just popped out and in again.",0
"“Now, my girl, was it you who admitted Madame Daubreuil to the house last night?” “Not last night, monsieur, the night before.” “But Françoise has just told us that Madame Daubreuil was here last night?” “No, monsieur. A lady did come to see M. Renauld last night, but it was not Madame Daubreuil.” Surprised, the magistrate insisted, but the girl held firm. She knew Madame Daubreuil perfectly by sight. This lady was dark also, but shorter, and much younger. Nothing could shake her statement. “Had you ever seen this lady before?” “Never, monsieur.” And then the girl added diffidently: “But I think she was English.",0
"“You believe that she deliberately went back?” “It would seem so, sir. She ran upstairs while I was getting the door open.” “H’m, she must belong to the gang, then; but, being a woman, didn’t feel like standing by to see a personable young man killed. But evidently she’s in with them, or she wouldn’t have gone back.” “I can’t believe she’s really one of them, sir. She seemed so different ” “Good-looking, I suppose?” said Mr. Carter with a smile that made Tommy flush to the roots of his hair. He admitted Annette’s beauty rather shamefacedly.",0
"Have you not realized that she is an unusually jealous woman? As I was saying, her pride and jealousy have been laid aside. She thinks of nothing but her husband, and the terrible fate that is hanging over him.” He spoke very feelingly, and I looked at him earnestly, remembering that last afternoon, when he had been deliberating whether or not to speak. With his tenderness for “a woman’s happiness,” I felt glad that the decision had been taken out of his hands. “Even now,” I said, “I can hardly believe it. You see, up to the very last minute, I thought it was Lawrence!” Poirot grinned.",0
"” Afraid of being discovered listening, Graves had then hurried out to do his master’s errand. This evening the two men had arrived punctually at eight. During dinner they had talked of indifferent matters politics, the weather, and the theatrical world. When Graves had placed the port upon the table and brought in the coffee his master told him that he might have the evening off. “Was that a usual proceeding of his when he had guests?” asked the inspector. “No, sir; it wasn’t.",0
"The second Chinese attendant had reappeared. One of them brought food and drink and offered it to me, but I waved them aside. I was sick sick at heart And then suddenly the master reappeared tall and stately in his silken robes. He directed operations. By his orders I was hustled back through the cellar and tunnel into the original house I had entered. There they took me into a ground floor room. The windows were shuttered, but one could see through the cracks into the street.",0
"John Cavendish was waiting on the platform, and piloted me out to the car. “Got a drop or two of petrol still, you see,” he remarked. “Mainly owing to the mater’s activities.” The village of Styles St. Mary was situated about two miles from the little station, and Styles Court lay a mile the other side of it. It was a still, warm day in early July. As one looked out over the flat Essex country, lying so green and peaceful under the afternoon sun, it seemed almost impossible to believe that, not so very far away, a great war was running its appointed course. I felt I had suddenly strayed into another world.",0
"But Monsieur, he was like a thundercloud all day! Impossible to please him!” The sound of a door shutting upstairs cut short Léonie’s loquacity. “And Françoise who awaits me!” she exclaimed, awakening to a tardy remembrance of her duties. “That old one, she always scolds.” “One moment, mademoiselle. The examining magistrate, where is he?” “They have gone out to look at the automobile in the garage. Monsieur the commissary had some idea that it might have been used on the night of the murder.” “Quelle idée,” murmured Poirot, as the girl disappeared. “You will go out and join them?” “No, I shall await their return in the salon. It is cool there on this hot morning.",0
"[Illustration] Poirot locked the door on the inside, and proceeded to a minute inspection of the room. He darted from one object to the other with the agility of a grasshopper. I remained by the door, fearing to obliterate any clues. Poirot, however, did not seem grateful to me for my forbearance. “What have you, my friend,” he cried, “that you remain there like how do you say it? ah, yes, the stuck pig?” I explained that I was afraid of obliterating any foot-marks. “Foot-marks? But what an idea! There has already been practically an army in the room! What foot-marks are we likely to find? No, come here and aid me in my search.",0
"“Tuppence.” “She remembered the proverb about the good dying young, I suppose. There must be a certain amount of original sin in me to have survived. Where is Tuppence, by the way?” “Isn’t she here?” “No, the fellows at the office said she’d just gone out.” “Gone shopping, I guess. I dropped her here in the car about an hour ago. But, say, can’t you shed that British calm of yours, and get down to it? What on God’s earth have you been doing all this time?” “If you’re feeding here,” replied Tommy, “order now. It’s going to be a long story.",0
"Secretly, I was not dissatisfied with her collapse. It proved that she was not quite so callous as I had thought her. After all she was little more than a child, and her curiosity had probably been of the unthinking order. “I did my best to stop you, you know,” I said gently. “I suppose you did. Well, good-bye.” “Look here, you can’t start off like that all alone. You’re not fit for it. I insist on accompanying you back to Merlinville.” “Nonsense. I’m quite all right now.” “Supposing you felt faint again? No, I shall come with you.” But this she combated with a good deal of energy.",0
"When the short man had finished with me, he joined the other, and they forced my husband to get up and accompany them into the dressing-room next door. I was nearly fainting with terror, nevertheless I listened desperately. “They were speaking in too low a tone for me to hear what they said. But I recognized the language, a bastard Spanish such as is spoken in some parts of South America. They seemed to be demanding something from my husband, and presently they grew angry, and their voices rose a little. I think the tall man was speaking. ‘You know what we want!’ he said.",0
"He brought me unsugared tea, stone cold, at 6, and I then fell asleep utterly exhausted, to awaken just outside Bulawayo and be landed with a beastly wooden giraffe, all legs and neck! But for these small contretemps, all had been going smoothly. And then fresh calamity befell. It was the night of our arrival at the Falls. I was dictating to Miss Pettigrew in my sitting-room, when suddenly Mrs. Blair burst in without a word of excuse and wearing most compromising attire. “Where’s Anne?” she cried. A nice question to ask. As though I were responsible for the girl.",0
"We had a late luncheon and spent the afternoon resting in the garden. I noticed that John’s manner was somewhat unusual. He seemed very excited and restless. After tea, Mrs. Inglethorp went to lie down to rest before her efforts in the evening and I challenged Mary Cavendish to a single at tennis. About a quarter to seven, Mrs. Inglethorp called us that we should be late as supper was early that night. We had rather a scramble to get ready in time; and before the meal was over the motor was waiting at the door. The entertainment was a great success, Mrs.",0
"“Do you young people want lights, or do you enjoy the twilight?” she asked. “Will you take Mrs. Inglethorp her coffee, Cynthia? I will pour it out.” “Do not trouble, Mary,” said Inglethorp. “I will take it to Emily.” He poured it out, and went out of the room carrying it carefully. Lawrence followed him, and Mrs. Cavendish sat down by us. We three sat for some time in silence. It was a glorious night, hot and still. Mrs. Cavendish fanned herself gently with a palm leaf. “It’s almost too hot,” she murmured. “We shall have a thunderstorm.",0
"I searched diligently, but with growing annoyance. Finally, I shut the last book with a bang. There appeared to be no such place as Kilmorden Castle. Here was an unexpected check. There must be such a place. Why should any one invent a name like that and write it down on a piece of paper? Absurd! Another idea occurred to me. Possibly it was a castellated abomination in the suburbs with a high-sounding name invented by its owner. But if so, it was going to be extraordinarily hard to find.",0
"Roger Havering discharged one shot from it, brought it up to London, went straight to his club to establish his alibi, then went quickly out to Ealing by the district, a matter of about twenty minutes only, placed the parcel where it was found and so back to town. That charming creature, his wife, quietly shoots Mr. Pace after dinner you remember he was shot from behind? Another significant point, that! reloads the revolver and puts it back in its place, and then starts off with her desperate little comedy.” “It’s incredible,” I murmured, fascinated, “and yet” “And yet it is true. Bien sur, my friend, it is true.",0
"At last we neared the scene of the excavations. A sunburnt man with a grey beard, in white clothes and wearing a helmet, came to meet us. “Monsieur Poirot and Captain Hastings? We received your cable. I’m sorry that there was no one to meet you in Cairo. An unforeseen event occurred which completely disorganized our plans.” Poirot paled. His hand, which had stolen to his clothes-brush, stayed its course. “Not another death?” he breathed. “Yes.” “Sir Guy Willard?” I cried. “No, Captain Hastings. My American colleague, Mr. Schneider.” “And the cause?” demanded Poirot. “Tetanus.” I blanched.",0
"Only one thing had been taken ‘the Western Star.’” We stared at each other the whole thing was so bizarre, so unreal. Poirot hopped briskly to his feet. “I have not been of much use, I fear,” he said regretfully. “Is it permitted to see Madame?” “I guess she’s prostrated with the shock,” explained Rolf. “Then perhaps I might have a few words alone with you, monsieur?” “Certainly.” In about five minutes Poirot reappeared. “Now, my friend,” he said gaily. “To a post office. I have to send a telegram.” “Who to?” “Lord Yardly.” He discounted further inquiries by slipping his arm through mine.",0
"He stopped at a local cottage hospital, where it was dressed and bound up he did not, of course, reveal his identity. He then drove, as per schedule, straight to Charing Cross, where a special train for Dover was awaiting him, and, after a brief account of what had happened had been given to the anxious police by Captain Daniels, he duly departed for France. At Dover, he went on board the waiting destroyer. At Boulogne, as you know, the bogus car was waiting for him, carrying the Union Jack, and correct in every detail.” “That is all you have to tell me?” “Yes.” “There is no other circumstance that you have omitted, milord?” “Well, there is one rather peculiar thing.",0
"Presently I heard a low murmur of voices come up to me. Evidently the other man or men whoever they were, had arrived first at the rendezvous. I crawled cautiously out of the bushes, and inch by inch, using the utmost precaution against noise, I wormed myself down the steep path. Only a boulder now separated me from the talking men. Secure in the blackness, I peeped round the edge of it and found myself facing the muzzle of a black, murderous-looking automatic! ""Hands up!"" said Mr. Ryland succinctly. ""I've been waiting for you.",0
"Inglethorp’s bell wire was neatly cut, and on Monday evening Mademoiselle Cynthia was spending the night with friends, so that Mrs. Inglethorp would have been quite alone in the right wing, completely shut off from help of any kind, and would have died, in all probability, before medical aid could have been summoned. But in her hurry to be in time for the village entertainment Mrs. Inglethorp forgot to take her medicine, and the next day she lunched away from home, so that the last and fatal dose was actually taken twenty-four hours later than had been anticipated by the murderer; and it is owing to that delay that the final proof the last link of the chain is now in my hands.",0
"“So beautiful, so beautiful, and yet, the poor family, plunged in sorrow, prostrated with grief.” He looked at me keenly as he spoke, and I was aware that I reddened under his prolonged gaze. Was the family prostrated by grief? Was the sorrow at Mrs. Inglethorp’s death so great? I realized that there was an emotional lack in the atmosphere. The dead woman had not the gift of commanding love. Her death was a shock and a distress, but she would not be passionately regretted. Poirot seemed to follow my thoughts. He nodded his head gravely.",0
"Miss Howard, in particular, took no pains to conceal her feelings. Mrs. Inglethorp, however, seemed to notice nothing unusual. Her volubility, which I remembered of old, had lost nothing in the intervening years, and she poured out a steady flood of conversation, mainly on the subject of the forthcoming bazaar which she was organizing and which was to take place shortly. Occasionally she referred to her husband over a question of days or dates. His watchful and attentive manner never varied.",0
"He’s leaving Cape Town to-day, by the by, to join Sir Eustace in Johannesburg.” “I see,” I said thoughtfully. “And the small ones, where are they?” “I suppose Sir Eustace has got them with him.” I turned the matter over in my mind. “Well,” I said at last, “it’s awkward but it’s safe enough. We’d better do nothing for the present.” Suzanne looked at me with a little smile. “You don’t like doing nothing, do you, Anne?” “Not very much,” I replied honestly. The one thing I could do was to get hold of a time-table and see what time Guy Pagett’s train would pass through Kimberley. I found that it would arrive at 5.",0
"""I have reappeared again,” I told him solemnly. “And how are you, Mr. Pagett?” “Very well, thank you looking forward to taking up my work again with Sir Eustace.” “Mr. Pagett,” I said, “there is something I want to ask you. I hope that you won’t be offended, but a lot hangs on it, more than you can possibly guess. I want to know what you were doing at Marlow on the 8th of January last?” He started violently. “Really, Miss Beddingfeld I indeed” “You were there, weren’t you?” “I for reasons of my own I was in the neighbourhood, yes.” “Won’t you tell me what those reasons were?” “Sir Eustace has not already told you?” “Sir Eustace? Does he know?” “I am almost sure that he does.",0
"4, Miss Pettigrew, who, I have no doubt, is really a particularly dangerous crook in disguise! Probably one of Pagett’s Italian friends that he has palmed off on me. I shouldn’t wonder if the world found some day that it had been grossly deceived by Pagett. On the whole, I think Rayburn was the best of the bunch. He never worried me or got in my way. Guy Pagett has had the impertinence to have the stationery trunk put in here. None of us can move without falling over it. I went out on the observation platform just now, expecting my appearance to be greeted with hails of delight. Both the women were listening spellbound to one of Race’s travellers’ tales.",0
"I'm well hid here, I hope, but any day they may get me. The Big Four, I mean. It's life or death. I've plenty of money, but I daren't get at it, for fear of putting them wise. Send me a couple of hundred in notes. I'll repay it faithful I swear to that. Your servant, sir, ""JONATHAN WHALLEY."" ""Dated from Granite Bungalow, Hoppaton, Dartmoor. I'm afraid I regarded it as rather a crude method of relieving me of a couple of hundred which I can ill spare. If it's any use to you "" He held it out. ""Je vous remercie, monsieur.",0
"I told him, what was true, that I liked him very much, that I hoped to come to like him more, but that I was not in any way what the world calls ‘in love’ with him. He declared that that satisfied him, and so we were married.” She waited a long time, a little frown had gathered on her forehead. She seemed to be looking back earnestly into those past days. “I think I am sure he cared for me at first. But I suppose we were not well matched. Almost at once, we drifted apart. He it is not a pleasing thing for my pride, but it is the truth tired of me very soon.",0
"There were shouts, oaths, and then a sound of firing. Sir Eustace paled. “What’s that?” “Race and his people. You didn’t know, did you, Sir Eustace, that Anne had an arrangement with me by which we should know whether communications from one to the other were genuine? Telegrams were to be signed ‘Andy,’ letters were to have the word ‘and’ crossed out somewhere in them. Anne knew that your telegram was a fake. She came here of her own free will, walked deliberately into the snare, in the hope that she might catch you in your own trap. Before leaving Kimberley she wired both to me and to Race.",0
"Even if they discover that the Captain Hastings who landed in South America is an imposter (and I do not think they will discover it, they are not likely to send an agent out there who knows you personally), they will only believe that you are trying to circumvent them in some clever manner of your own, and will pay no serious attention to discovering your whereabouts. Of the one vital fact, my supposed death, they are thoroughly convinced. They will go ahead and mature their plans."" ""And then?"" I asked eagerly.",0
"You can guess, I dare say. But I’ll tell you this I’ll clear my name, or die in the attempt, and I’ll choke the life out of the damned scoundrel who did his best to murder you the other night.” “We must be fair,” I said. “He didn’t actually push me over.” “He’d no need to. His plan was cleverer than that. I went up to the path afterwards. Everything looked all right, but by the marks on the ground I saw that the stones which outline the path had been taken up and put down again in a slightly different place. There are tall bushes growing just over the edge.",0
"She had a horrible feeling of being slowly hemmed in on every side. “You see,” she explained to Jane, “if they think we’re going to Sir James, this will put them off the scent. Now they’ll imagine we’re going to Mr. Carter. His country place is north of London somewhere.” Crossing Holborn there was a block, and the taxi was held up. This was what Tuppence had been waiting for. “Quick,” she whispered. “Open the right-hand door!” The two girls stepped out into the traffic. Two minutes later they were seated in another taxi and were retracing their steps, this time direct to Carlton House Terrace. “There,” said Tuppence, with great satisfaction, “this ought to do them.",0
"“Only the doctors can tell us that, Mr. Mace.” “Yes, exactly of course ” The young man hesitated, and then his agitation was too much for him. He clutched Poirot by the arm, and sank his voice to a whisper: “Just tell me this, Mr. Poirot, it isn’t it isn’t strychnine, is it?” I hardly heard what Poirot replied. Something evidently of a non-committal nature. The young man departed, and as he closed the door Poirot’s eyes met mine. “Yes,” he said, nodding gravely. “He will have evidence to give at the inquest.” We went slowly upstairs again. I was opening my lips, when Poirot stopped me with a gesture of his hand. “Not now, not now, mon ami. I have need of reflection.",0
"No, the sixth point I will keep to myself for the present.” He looked quickly round the room. “There is nothing more to be done here, I think, unless” he stared earnestly and long at the dead ashes in the grate. “The fire burns and it destroys. But by chance there might be let us see!” Deftly, on hands and knees, he began to sort the ashes from the grate into the fender, handling them with the greatest caution. Suddenly, he gave a faint exclamation. “The forceps, Hastings!” I quickly handed them to him, and with skill he extracted a small piece of half charred paper. “There, mon ami!” he cried. “What do you think of that?” I scrutinized the fragment.",0
"Tommy followed him at a judicious distance. They reached at length a small dilapidated square. The houses there had a sinister air in the midst of their dirt and decay. Boris looked round, and Tommy drew back into the shelter of a friendly porch. The place was almost deserted. It was a cul-de-sac, and consequently no traffic passed that way. The stealthy way the other had looked round stimulated Tommy’s imagination. From the shelter of the doorway he watched him go up the steps of a particularly evil-looking house and rap sharply, with a peculiar rhythm, on the door. It was opened promptly, he said a word or two to the doorkeeper, then passed inside.",0
"""In the midst of my research breakthroughs, I have obtained a limited amount of radium from a generous source. Despite its small size, this sample holds immense value, accounting for a significant portion of the world's stock and worth millions of francs."" ""And its whereabouts?"" ""Safely stored within a lead case inside a seemingly antiquated large safe. The safe's exterior gives the impression of age and wear, yet its design is a masterpiece of security. This likely explains why any attempts by thieves to breach it have failed.""",1
"""Your thoughts tend to be rather uncouth, Captain Hastings, in my opinion."" ""You fiend,"" I exclaimed, seething with anger, ""you embodiment of evil!"" ""Slightly agitated, just a tad agitated. Your deceased friend would have informed you that a man who remains composed always holds a significant advantage."" ""You have the audacity to mention him,"" I shouted. ""The man you viciously murdered. And yet you show up here "" He cut me off. ""I arrived here with a noble and tranquil intention. To recommend that you promptly head back to South America. If you comply, that will conclude the matter in regards to the Big Four.""",1
"As our people meticulously search through every inch of France, so do the French authorities. I have a sinking feeling that time is running out."" The tall detective grimly added, ""That is, if he's still breathing."" Japp's expression darkened. ""Yes, but there's something telling me he's still holding on."" Poirot concurred, ""Indeed, he's alive. But will we locate him in time? I, like all of you, never imagined he could remain hidden for so long."" The sound of the whistle signaled our departure into the Pullman car. Reluctantly, the train pulled away from the station. The journey was filled with tension as the Scotland Yard detectives huddled together, studying maps of Northern France with intense focus.",1
"""The whole lot of them are desperate for money, constantly hounding her. I did my best to shield her. But now that I'm gone, they'll take advantage of her."" ""Don't worry, Miss Howard,"" I assured her, ""I'll do whatever I can. But you seem quite agitated and anxious."" She cut me off by wagging her finger slowly. ""Listen here, young man. I've been around much longer than you. Just keep watchful. You'll understand soon enough."" The hum of the engine filtered in through the window, prompting Miss Howard to stand up and head towards the door.",1
"Our investigation led us to retrace familiar paths, yet yielded no new insights beyond the account provided by Mrs. Halliday. Poirot engaged in a thorough discussion with Professor Bourgoneau, probing for any mention of Halliday's intentions for the evening, but the effort proved fruitless. Turning to our last hope, we sought out the renowned Madame Olivier. Eager anticipation filled me as we ascended the staircase to her residence in Passy. The notion of a woman achieving such eminence in the realm of science never failed to astonish me. One might assume that such endeavors required a mind of purely masculine nature.",1
"The furniture and house had finally been sold off, managing to cover our outstanding debts. Despite my efforts, I had yet to secure a job. Truth be told, I wasn't exactly eager to find one! I firmly believed that if I sought out adventure, it would come to me. In my experience, one's desires always come to fruition. And soon enough, my belief was put to the test. It happened on a cold January 8th, right after an unsuccessful meeting with a woman seeking a secretary-companion, though it seemed she really needed a laborer willing to toil twelve hours a day for a measly £25 per year.",1
"Later, in her small office on the top floor of the building, she snacked on pastries and pondered what the Esthonia Glassware Co. could possibly want from her. A thrill of excitement ran through Tuppence as she considered the possibilities. The image of the country vicarage faded into the background once again, overshadowed by the intrigue of the morrow. Tuppence found it difficult to fall asleep that night, her mind consumed by dreams of washing stacks of Esthonia Glassware that oddly resembled hospital dishes. As Tuppence arrived at the block of buildings housing the Esthonia Glassware Co. offices, the clock showed five minutes to eleven.",1
"“The victim predicted his own demise? That certainly complicates things! But please, step inside.” He gestured towards the open gate, leading the way towards the house. As we walked, M. Bex filled us in: “The investigating magistrate, M. Hautet, needs to be informed immediately. He just wrapped up his examination of the crime scene and is preparing for the interrogations. A delightful man. You'll find him quite personable. Unconventional in his approach, but a fair arbiter.” Poirot inquired, “Do we know the time of death?” “The body was found this morning around nine o’clock. Testimonies from Madame Renauld and the medical experts suggest that the fatal incident likely took place around 2 a.",1
"I struggled for what felt like an eternity to free myself from the tight bonds that held me captive. Through sheer determination, I managed to cut through the ropes around my wrists, restoring feeling to my hands. As I cautiously made my way through the deserted house, I overheard a conversation that sent chills down my spine. The mention of diamonds and secret information piqued my curiosity, but also filled me with dread. It was clear that danger lurked in the shadows, and I knew I had to tread carefully. Time was running out, and I needed to find a way out before it was too late.",1
"He stood up to greet me when I entered the room, taking both of my hands in his and patting them gently. ""My dear child,"" he whispered. ""My dear, dear child."" Despite myself, I couldn't help but feel like a vulnerable orphan in his presence. His demeanor was soothing and paternal, yet there was an underlying hint of condescension. It was clear that he saw me as a naive young woman facing a harsh world alone. I quickly realized that there was no point in trying to prove him wrong. And in the end, maybe it was for the best that I didn't.",1
"Poirot’s expression turned somber as he listened to the grave situation unfolding. The looming threat of the Prime Minister's kidnapping cast a shadow over the upcoming Conference, set to commence at nine o’clock the following night. The absence of the Prime Minister, the key figure with a strong personality, could lead to disastrous consequences, potentially derailing any hopes for a peaceful resolution. The Pacifist propaganda orchestrated by German agents added another layer of complexity to the already tense atmosphere. Time was running out, and there seemed to be no suitable replacement who could effectively represent England in such a crucial moment.",1
"""The elderly man was losing money at an alarming rate. Four thousand gone in just a few months. Whew! I just mentioned there was something suspicious about Renauld. It seems this Madame Daubreuil had enough information to apply pressure."" ""It could be,"" the chief exclaimed with excitement. ""Definitely a possibility."" ""Possibility?"" Stonor shouted. ""It's a fact! Have you talked to Mrs. Renauld about your romantic investigation?"" ""No, sir. We didn't want to cause her unnecessary distress."" ""Distress? She would scoff at you. Let me tell you, she and Renauld were an exceptional pair."" ""Ah, that reminds me of something else,"" M. Hautet interjected.",1
"“Only stopping by for a brief visit, but it caught my interest. A minor detail, yet I thought it was worth looking into.” Poirot raised an eyebrow. M. Hautet agreed, with a hint of disappointment. “We have to accept the truth, I'm afraid. Giraud, uncouth as he may be, is undeniably clever! Slim chance of him slipping up.” “You don't believe so, M. le juge?” The magistrate simply shrugged. “Well, to be honest, between us, it's clear. Can you see it any other way?”",1
"""May I inquire about the departure times of the final train from Merlinville station?"" questioned Poirot. ""The schedule shows eleven-fifty going one direction and 12:17 in the other, however the possibility of a waiting motor seems more feasible."" Poirot, appearing slightly disappointed, nodded in agreement. ""Indeed, that could be a valuable lead,"" remarked the magistrate optimistically. ""A motor with two foreigners would surely attract attention. Well noted, M. Bex."" With a brief smile, the magistrate turned serious once more, addressing Mrs. Renauld, ""Now, there is another matter to discuss.""",1
"“You’re quite clever, Rita, but also quite foolish! Trust me, and abandon Peel Edgerton.” Mrs. Vandemeyer gently shook her head. “I must decline.” “You’re refusing?” The Russian’s voice took on a harsh tone. “Indeed.” “Then, by Heaven,” growled the Russian, “we shall see.” But Mrs. Vandemeyer stood up as well, her eyes ablaze. “Don’t forget, Boris,” she remarked. “I answer to no one. My orders come solely from Mr. Brown.” The Russian raised his hands in defeat. “You’re impossible,” he grumbled. “Impossible! It may already be too late.”",1
"""I hesitated to linger at the Falls, worried he may have taken you nearby, but was unsure how to handle the diamonds. I was too scared to hold onto them,"" Suzanne glanced nervously around, checking for eavesdroppers, then leaned in close to whisper urgently. ""A wise decision,"" I agreed. ""At the moment, anyway. It's complicated now. Where did Sir Eustace send the cases?"" ""The large ones were shipped off to Cape Town. Pagett informed me before I departed the Falls, and he included the storage receipt.""",1
"Poirot scanned the room, taking note of the key details that I had outlined in a diagram. ""Where does that door lead?"" he asked, gesturing towards the one beside the window. ""Into the next room, I think,"" replied the inspector. ""It's locked from this side."" Poirot approached the door, tested it, then unlocked and retested it. ""And locked on the other side too,"" he observed. ""That avenue is closed."" Moving on, he inspected the windows one by one.",1
"""Listen to the Professor's daughter,"" Suzanne interjected as I presented my argument. ""It may be true. However, Pagett could be seen as the Grand Vizier, in a sense, of the All Highest."" I paused for a moment, deep in thought. ""I wonder how Sir Eustace accumulated his wealth."" ""Are you suspecting him once more?"" ""Suzanne, I've reached a point where suspicion comes naturally! I'm not truly suspecting him, but he is Pagett's boss, and he was the previous owner of the Mill House.""",1
"The month was June, with daylight still lingering at eight o’clock but fading by half-past. Does that ring a bell? I sense a vague inkling that you will come around eventually. Moving on, the coffee was incredibly dark, in stark contrast to Count Foscatini’s gleaming white teeth. Coffee tends to stain teeth, leading us to deduce that Count Foscatini abstained from it. However, all three cups contained coffee. So, why would someone fabricate the notion that Count Foscatini had imbibed coffee when he hadn’t? Perplexed, I shook my head, seeking clarity. ""Let me assist you,"" he said.",1
"""Tuppence's mood lifted instantly. She dismissed Mr. Carter's cautions without a second thought. The young woman's self-assurance was unwavering, rendering his advice inconsequential. Reluctantly, she set aside her captivating plan. Despite her unwavering belief in her ability to maintain a facade indefinitely, she was pragmatic enough to acknowledge the validity of Mr. Carter's points. Still no sign of Tommy, yet a slightly stained postcard arrived in the morning mail, bearing the simple message: ""All clear.""",1
"I was fixated on him. The man, named Carton, hailed from Kimberley and was a diamond-sorter under De Beers'. I ventured to Kimberley to uncover more about him, armed with my revolver. Carton confessed his involvement in a robbery scheme with Anita Grünberg, whom he revealed to be his estranged wife. He divulged that Anita had kept some stolen stones for leverage against the mysterious 'Colonel'. Carton suggested striking a deal with Anita to expose the 'Colonel' in exchange for a hefty sum. Despite Carton's shaky credibility, I pondered his proposal and returned to the hotel, waiting anxiously.",1
"""She may have accidentally destroyed the new one, thinking it was the previous one in his favor. Her animosity towards him is intense."" ""Do you find her hostility to be abnormal?"" ""Yes. She is extremely fierce. I even questioned her mental stability on this issue."" Poirot vigorously disagreed, ""No, no, you're mistaken. Miss Howard is not feeble-minded or unstable. She represents a perfect example of a well-rounded English individual. She is the epitome of sanity."" ""But her obsession with Inglethorp borders on mania.""",1
"Julius started to speak, but then stopped himself short. ""I apologize, Miss Tuppence. The office staff insisted that Beresford had left and hadn't been around since Wednesday. Is that true?"" Tuppence confirmed. ""Do you have any idea where he might be?"" she asked quietly. ""Me? How could I possibly know? I haven't received a single word from him, despite sending a telegram yesterday."" ""I bet your message is still sitting at the office, unopened."" ""But where could he have gone?"" ""I have no clue. I was hoping you might know."" ""I'm telling you, I haven't heard a peep from him since we said goodbye at the station on Wednesday."" ""Which station?"" ""Waterloo.""",1
"I glanced at Mary, a sense of dread washing over me. ""He's going to get caught by the police any moment now. Look, he's turning the corner!"" Our eyes locked in silent panic. ""What on earth is happening?"" I shook my head, at a loss. ""He was playing with cards and then suddenly he got an idea and ran off."" ""I'm sure he'll be back for dinner,"" Mary reassured me. But as night descended, Poirot was still nowhere to be found. His sudden disappearance left us all puzzled. The hours ticked by on Sunday morning, with no sign of his return in sight.",1
"Mr. MacAdam, a weak-throated man, carefully preserved his voice before important speeches. The deception was maintained until reaching France, where it became impractical. The Prime Minister's disappearance led the police across the Channel, diverting attention from the initial attack. To maintain the illusion of the abduction in France, Daniels was effectively gagged and chloroformed. The impostor Prime Minister and his fake chauffeur were eventually released due to lack of evidence, while the real Prime Minister and O'Murphy sought refuge with 'Mrs. Everard' in Hampstead. Poirot's keen observation skills led him to uncover the truth, much to his satisfaction.",1
"Poirot interrupted: “You are wrong. There is one other person who could have taken the dagger.” “You refer to M. Stonor? He arrived at the front door, in an automobile which had brought him straight from Calais. Now as to means. Jack Renauld was in Merlinville that night. He concealed the fact which turned suspicion into certainty. Then we found a second victim stabbed with the same dagger. We know when that dagger was stolen. Captain Hastings here can fix the time. Jack Renauld, arriving from Cherbourg, was the only person who could have taken it. I have accounted for all the other members of the household.”",1
"""Who was responsible for tampering with the will? Was it the same person who left the candle wax on the floor? Most likely. But how did they manage to enter when all the doors were securely locked from the inside? ""Let's go, my friend,"" Poirot announced, ""I need to speak with the parlourmaid Dorcas. That's her name, isn't it?"" After a quick inspection of Alfred Inglethorp's room, we exited, ensuring to lock both his door and Mrs. Inglethorp's room just as we had done previously.",1
"When I continue to pursue the criminal, he will remain unsuspecting. But now, he will be extra cautious. Yes, extra cautious."" He suddenly looked at me. ""Hastings, do you have any suspicions?"" I paused. An outlandish idea had crossed my mind earlier, though I dismissed it as ridiculous. Yet, it lingered. ""It's not really a suspicion,"" I said softly. ""It seems too foolish."" ""Go on,"" Poirot pressed. ""Don't hold back. Share your thoughts.""",1
"""But I kept pondering over it. "" She hesitated, her cheeks flushing with embarrassment. ""Did something specific happen to make you suspicious?"" Poirot inquired. ""Yes."" Despite her best efforts, she struggled to continue. ""I overheard the staff making comments as well."" ""Regarding Mr. Templeton's health?"" ""Oh, no! It was about something else."" ""Mrs. Templeton?"" ""Yes."" ""Possibly involving Mrs. Templeton and the physician?"" Poirot had a knack for these situations. The nurse shot him a thankful look and proceeded. ""There were whispers. And then, one afternoon, I witnessed them together in the garden."" And that was the end of it.",1
"""I meticulously reviewed the case once more, reaching the same conclusion as previously. If not Bella Duveen, then the only other suspect could be Marthe Daubreuil. Yet, I lacked any concrete evidence against her. ""But when you presented me with that letter from Mademoiselle Dulcie, I glimpsed an opportunity to finally resolve the issue. The initial dagger had been taken by Dulcie Duveen, cast into the sea under the mistaken belief that it belonged to her sibling.",1
"Leaving the girl hidden in the bushes, I made my way into the residence. Marchaud stood guard by the entrance to the salon. Inside, voices whispered in conversation. ""Is Monsieur in need of Hautet? He's inside, questioning Françoise once more."" ""No,"" I quickly replied, ""I have no use for him. However, I do require the key to the shed outside, if it's not forbidden."" ""But of course, monsieur."" He handed it over. ""Here you go. Judge M. ordered that you have full access to everything. Just return it to me once you're done, that's all."" ""Certainly.""",1
"A man sought shelter in my quarters. He was in a state of shock, but he revealed enough to pique our curiosity about this Li Chang Yen. He spoke of four individuals known as the Big Four, an organization previously unheard of. Number One identified as Li Chang Yen, Number Two an unidentified American, Number Three a mysterious Frenchwoman, and Number Four, the likely leader of the group, referred to as the destroyer. Unfortunately, my source passed away. Do you happen to be familiar with the phrase 'The Big Four'?"" ""I have not heard it in relation to Li Chang Yen. However, it does sound vaguely familiar. I recall encountering it recently in a rather unusual context.""",1
"Tuppence was a natural at her new role, showing no signs of hesitation. The archdeacon's daughters had taught her well, preparing her for household duties and the task of training new staff. Tuppence knew that once she was trained, she would likely seek better pay elsewhere. Despite this, she was confident in her abilities. The cook, however, was a mystery to her. It was clear that she was afraid of her mistress, leading Tuppence to suspect that the cook was being controlled in some way.",1
"""Listen, I'm not naive, sir. I can face the truth head-on. He's innocent, and we need to help him,"" she declared with determination, pausing briefly to reflect. Poirot studied her closely and asked, ""Is there something you're holding back, something that could be important for us to know?"" She hesitated before admitting, ""Yes, there is something, but it's so unbelievable that I'm not sure you'll take it seriously."" ""Please, go on,"" urged Poirot. ""Well, M. Giraud called me in at the last minute to see if I could identify the man inside,"" she revealed, gesturing towards the shed.",1
"“After the disastrous turn of events, wouldn’t it be best to make a swift exit?” “But what about the exquisite dinner Lord Yardly’s chef has prepared?” “Forget the dinner,” I snapped. Poirot looked scandalized. “Mon Dieu! You Brits take food too lightly.” “There’s another pressing matter that requires our attention,” I pressed on. “And what might that be?” “The second diamond,” I whispered. “Miss Marvell’s.” “Well, what about it?” “Can’t you see?” His lack of understanding frustrated me.",1
"Conrad had the key to the door, so he couldn't expect much help from Annette. With the only way out being the door, he knew he would have to wait for the two men to return. Tommy, however, smiled as he carefully made his way through the dark room and took down the famous picture. He was pleased that his original plan was not in vain. Now all he could do was wait. And wait he did. The night dragged on slowly, feeling like an eternity to Tommy. Finally, he heard footsteps approaching. Tommy stood up, took a deep breath, and tightly held onto the picture.",1
"""No, no, you’re getting morbid on the subject.” “Enough to make a man morbid, to be stalked by beastly journalists and stared at by gaping moon-faced idiots, wherever he goes! But there’s worse than that.” “What?” John lowered his voice: “Have you ever thought, Hastings it’s a nightmare to me who did it? I can’t help feeling sometimes it must have been an accident. Because because who could have done it? Now Inglethorp’s out of the way, there’s no one else; no one, I mean, except one of us.” Yes, indeed, that was nightmare enough for any man! One of us? Yes, surely it must be so, unless - A new idea dawned on me.",1
"We were both immediately captivated by her, and the news hit us both like a ton of bricks. Surprisingly, it didn't strain our friendship in the least. In fact, we were both prepared to step back and let the other pursue her. However, that wasn't her intention. Looking back, I couldn't help but wonder why she didn't go for it, considering Sir Laurence Eardsley's son was quite the catch. As it turns out, she was secretly married to a De Beers' employee, a detail that had escaped everyone's notice.",1
"As we stepped out into the blinding winter sun, I couldn't contain my frustration. ""Poirot, I must say, your line of questioning was sorely lacking this time. Quite disappointing, really."" Poirot turned to me, his expression pleading. ""You believe so, Hastings?"" he inquired. ""I was completely thrown off, yes. What do you propose I should have asked?"" I pondered for a moment before laying out my interrogation strategy to Poirot. He appeared to be engrossed in my ideas, listening intently as we made our way back home. ""Impressive, Hastings, truly insightful,"" Poirot commended me as he unlocked the door and led the way up the stairs.",1
"But there was no assurance in reality that Anna the Adventuress wouldn't meet a sudden end at the conclusion of any Episode. I found myself in a difficult situation. The words Rayburn had spoken that morning echoed in my mind. ""Tell the truth,"" he had urged. But would it make any difference? Would anyone believe my account? How could they possibly accept that I embarked on this crazy journey based solely on a musty scrap of paper? It all sounded like a far-fetched story to me.",1
"""Get lost, Sonia."" She vanished without a word. ""Well, what is it?"" ""Dr. Savaronoff, you've inherited a fortune. If you were to die suddenly, who gets it?"" ""I've left everything to my niece, Sonia Daviloff, in my will. What are you implying?"" ""I'm not implying anything, but you haven't seen your niece in years. Anyone could pretend to be her."" The doctor was taken aback by the insinuation. Poirot continued calmly. ""That's all I have to say. Consider yourself warned.""",1
"Miss Cowley confided in him, ""I actually came up with the name Jane Finn! I was hesitant to use my own name in case it got me involved in something unsavory."" Tommy responded thoughtfully, ""That may be true, but you didn't come up with it."" ""What?"" ""No, I mentioned it to you. Remember, I mentioned yesterday that I overheard a conversation about a woman named Jane Finn? That's what triggered the name in your mind."" ""Oh yes, now I recall. How peculiar,"" Tuppence trailed off, lost in thought. Then, she suddenly snapped back to reality.",1
"""We opened the gate and proceeded up the narrow path towards the oak door, when a familiar figure appeared and approached us. “Japp!” I exclaimed. The Scotland Yard inspector smiled warmly at me before turning to my companion. “Mr. Havering, correct? I’ve been dispatched from London to oversee this investigation, and I would appreciate a moment of your time, sir.” “My wife” “I have already spoken with your wife and the housekeeper. I won’t detain you long, but I am eager to return to the village now that I have completed my examination here.” “I am not yet aware of the details” “Exactly,” Japp replied reassuringly.",1
"Ryland, with a calm demeanor, casually adjusted his cigar and arched his gray eyebrows. ""M. Hercule Poirot,"" Ryland uttered deliberately. ""What a pleasant surprise. You managed to deceive us all. We believed you were long gone. Nevertheless, the charade ends here."" His voice contained a hint of steel. Madame Olivier remained silent, her gaze intense, and I found her slow smile unsettling. ""Good evening, Madame and gentlemen,"" Poirot stated calmly. A surprising element in his tone caught my attention. Despite his apparent composure, there was a subtle change in his demeanor that I couldn't quite place.",1
"I received a call informing me of a man who wouldn't last long. Surprisingly, his pocket held a piece of paper with my name and address. Despite my astonishment, I agreed to go immediately. St. Giles' Hospital was located by the docks, making me wonder if the Chinaman had recently disembarked from a ship. As I made my way there, a sudden suspicion crossed my mind - was this all a setup orchestrated by Li Chang Yen? My thoughts drifted to the Baited Trap incident.",1
"""Ames, the professional accompanying the expedition, and Hassan, my husband's loyal native servant."" ""Can you recall the name of the American secretary?"" ""Harper, I believe, but I'm not certain. He hadn't been with Mr. Bleibner for very long. He was quite a pleasant young man."" ""Thank you, Lady Willard."" ""Is there anything else?"" ""Not at the moment. Trust me to handle it now, and rest assured I will do everything in my power to safeguard your son."" Lady Willard seemed unsettled by his less-than-reassuring words.",1
"""Savaronoff?""   ""Yes. Savaronoff fell foul of the Bolsheviks during the Revolution. He was even reported killed. In truth, he managed to escape, and spent three years enduring unimaginable hardships in the desolate wilderness of Siberia. His suffering has transformed him completely. Those who knew him before would scarcely believe it is the same man. His hair has turned white, and he now appears much older than his years.""",1
"Tommy strained to hear the conversation between the big man and his companion, known as Boris. The word ""Ireland"" was repeated several times, along with ""propaganda,"" but there was no mention of Jane Finn. Suddenly, in a brief pause, Tommy caught a complete phrase from Whittington, who was praising someone named Flossie as a marvel with the ability to deceive even an archbishop into believing she was his own mother.",1
"""And once again, there was nothing to be found. No balcony in sight."" ""Even if there was,"" the inspector remarked impatiently, ""I fail to see how that would be of any use to us, given that the maid claims she never left the room."" ""Of course,"" Poirot responded calmly, unfazed. ""If Mademoiselle is certain she did not exit the room."" Before he could continue, the chambermaid and the police searcher reappeared. ""Nothing,"" the searcher stated bluntly. ""Well, I should hope not,"" the chambermaid declared indignantly. ""And that French woman should be ashamed for tarnishing an innocent girl's reputation!"" ""There, there, my dear; it's all right,"" the inspector reassured, as he opened the door. ""No one suspects you.""",1
"The door creaked open slightly, and I overheard her conversing with someone in the hallway. She was part of their group! They suspected it could be a ruse on my end, so she was assigned to keep an eye on me! From then on, my confidence wavered. I couldn't bring myself to trust anyone. ""I think I even deluded myself. Gradually, I almost lost sight of my true identity as Jane Finn. I became so engrossed in portraying the role of Janet Vandemeyer that my nerves started to deceive me. I fell seriously ill for months, slipping into a state of lethargy. I was convinced that my end was near, and nothing seemed to hold significance.",1
"In a split second, we found refuge amidst the pine trees. Another person, facing a situation similar to mine, caught my eye. It dawned on me that even Poirot had fallen victim to this audacious scheme. With pure boldness, Number Four emerged victorious. It seemed that he had utilized a quick-acting aesthetic, likely ethyl chloride, by breaking a small vial of it under our noses. Amidst the chaos of darkness, his partners, potentially disguised as guests at the nearby table, silenced us with gags and swiftly whisked us away through the hotel to evade any pursuit. The events of the following hour are indescribable.",1
"""Did Renauld confide in you at all?""""Why would you assume he would confide in me?"" ""Because, madame,"" M. Hautet said with a hint of cruelty. ""A man often tells his mistress what he hides from his wife.""""How dare you!"" she exclaimed, moving closer with anger in her eyes. ""Sir, you offend me! I have nothing to say. Please leave my residence!""The lady clearly had the upper hand. We departed Villa Marguerite feeling like chastised schoolboys. The magistrate muttered to himself in frustration. Poirot appeared deep in thought. Abruptly, he snapped out of his contemplation and turned to M.",1
"Tuppence grew impatient as she awaited Julius' response. After a brief pause, he abruptly closed the door and declared, ""Nothing."" Soon after, a young doctor, summoned in haste, arrived and showed respect towards Sir James. The doctor suggested the cause of death may have been heart failure or an overdose of a sleeping aid, noting the smell of chloral in the air. Tuppence recalled the glass she had knocked over and rushed to the washstand. There, she discovered the partially filled bottle from which Mrs. Vandemeyer had poured a few drops.",1
"The man glanced around the room, his eyes lingering on each person in turn. ""A man should always look after his own people,"" he declared with a cold smile. Memories of that fateful night in Italy flooded back to him. The dinner, the esteemed Professor D, and the chilling conversation about insanity. The professor's words echoed in his mind, ""A great many men are mad, and no one knows it. They do not know it themselves."" The war had thrown everything into chaos, disrupting his carefully laid plans. The efficiency of the Germans and their formidable spy system only added to his unease. The streets were now teeming with young men in khaki, a constant reminder of the shifting tides of war.",1
"""Her appearance embodied the ideal of a traditional household servant. Initially wary of Poirot, she eventually opened up to him. Gesturing towards a chair, he spoke, 'Please, have a seat, mademoiselle.' 'Thank you, sir.' 'You've been in service to your mistress for many years, correct?' 'Ten years, sir.' 'A significant amount of time, showing great loyalty. You cared for her deeply, did you not?' 'She treated me well, sir.' 'In that case, you won't mind answering a few questions. I'll be asking alongside Mr.",1
"I could never forget the last words Flossie Monro whispered before taking her final breath. She revealed the peculiar habit of Claud Darrell, how he would nonchalantly dab his bread on the table to gather crumbs. It was a revelation that sent chills down my spine. The realization hit me like a ton of bricks - the vacant-looking young man we had seen earlier was none other than our arch enemy Number Four. There was no time to waste. Without a second thought, we swiftly descended the ivy, aiming straight for the nearby town and the waiting train. Just in the nick of time, we managed to board the 8.34 train, bound for our destination, the city, where danger awaited.",1
"Poirot hesitated before turning to M. Hautet. ""Let's head there now,"" he said quietly. As we made our way to the scene, I could sense Poirot's determination to uncover the truth behind the murder. However, when he finally spoke, it was with an odd awkwardness that seemed out of place. ""His overcoat was quite long,"" Poirot remarked, his voice strained. M. Hautet greeted us in the hall, and we followed Françoise upstairs. Poirot's erratic movement caught my attention, but he explained in a whisper, ""We must be cautious, the servants are listening.""",1
"""I never intended to enter, but Mr. Inglethorp insisted,"" said Bauerstein. John walked in from the hall and remarked, ""You seem to be in quite a predicament. Care for some coffee while you share your adventures?"" Bauerstein accepted the offer and recounted his mishap of finding a rare fern in a hard-to-reach spot, slipping into a nearby pond in the process. ""The sun quickly dried me off,"" he chuckled, ""but I must admit, I look quite disheveled."" Just then, Mrs. Inglethorp called for Cynthia from the hall, prompting the girl to hurry out.",1
"""By Jove, Poirot! I swear, I would pay a handsome sum to witness you truly make a fool of yourself just once. Your vanity knows no bounds!"" ""Please, do not distress yourself, Hastings. Honestly, there are moments when I believe you despise me! Ah, the burdens of brilliance!"" With a theatrical sigh, the little man inflated his chest, provoking a chuckle from me. On Tuesday, we embarked on a swift journey to Liverpool aboard a luxurious first-class carriage of the L. & N.W.R. Poirot stubbornly kept his suspicions and certainties shrouded in mystery, much to my frustration.",1
"""It appeared to her, while doing so, that the tension in Mrs. Vandemeyer's demeanor eased. ""I understand,"" she said after a pause. ""Is there someone I can contact for a recommendation?"" ""I resided previously with a Miss Dufferin, The Parsonage, Llanelly. I served under her for two years."" ""So, you decided to seek better pay by moving to London, I presume? Nevertheless, that is of no concern to me. I am willing to offer you £50 £60 whatever you desire. Can you start today?"" ""Certainly, ma'am. I can begin immediately. My belongings are at Paddington."" ""Retrieve them in a taxi, then. This position is undemanding. I spend a lot of time away from home.""",1
"But Pagett was already on the warpath. He insisted on recounting a tedious tale involving a roll of films and a reckless bet placed on the Kilmorden. The incident, which took place late at night, saw a steward foolishly tossing the films through a porthole. Disliking such pranks, I expressed my disapproval to Pagett, only to have him repeat the story in his usual inept manner. It took me a while to piece together the jumbled narrative. Our paths did not cross again until lunch, when he burst in with an air of excitement reminiscent of a bloodhound. Bloodhounds were never to my liking.",1
"We followed the directions given to us, leading us to a grand mansion nestled in the hills. The sprawling estate overlooked the city below, a stark contrast to the rundown buildings we had passed through earlier. As we approached the entrance, a figure emerged from the shadows, catching us by surprise. It was a woman, her expression unreadable as she studied us with a mix of curiosity and suspicion. We knew we were in the right place, but the real mystery was just beginning.",1
"There's no way to incriminate him since Miss Howard possesses the strychnine, meant to divert suspicion onto John Cavendish. However, a problem arises when Mrs. Inglethorp skips her medicine that night. The sabotaged bell, Cynthia's absence orchestrated by Inglethorp, all in vain. Then, he slips up. Mrs. Inglethorp is away, so he begins to pen a letter to his partner in crime, worried about their failed scheme. It's likely that Mrs. Inglethorp came back sooner than anticipated.",1
"""Yet another bill. It seems I've developed a taste for extravagance in my later years. Oh, what's this? A note from Japp."" I perked up, intrigued. The Scotland Yard Inspector had previously involved us in some intriguing cases. ""He's simply expressing his gratitude (in his own way) for a small detail I provided in the Aberystwyth Case. I'm pleased to have been able to assist him."" ""And how did he express his thanks?"" I inquired, knowing Japp's style. ""He was gracious enough to commend me for still being a keen player in the game at my age, and he appreciated the opportunity to involve me in the case.""",1
"I quickly realized that the girl was more interested in the crime scene than I had anticipated. Her fascination with the gruesome details was unsettling, but I couldn't deny the thrill of showing her around. As we approached the shed, I hesitated, knowing what we were about to see would be disturbing. But she was eager to continue, her curiosity outweighing any sense of caution. Inside, I revealed the victim's body, the sight of which caused her to recoil in horror. It was clear she had underestimated the impact of the scene. I couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction as she struggled to come to terms with the reality of the crime. In the end, she learned that some things are better left unseen.",1
"“It's beyond me! It's just plain stupid! They had everything planned out for the abduction, and it was all well thought out too. But instead of keeping it low-key, they decided to go all out with a melodramatic attack that seemed straight out of a movie. It's hard to take it seriously, with their group of masked men so close to London!” “Maybe there were two different groups trying to pull off the same thing at the same time,” I proposed. “No, that's too much of a coincidence! And besides, someone must have been a traitor in the first place.”",1
"""Upon receiving his assurance, we bid him farewell. True to his word, a hastily written message arrived the next day around eleven. It simply read, 'The Dulcibella Sisters performing at the Palace in Coventry. Best of luck.' Without hesitation, we immediately set off for Coventry.

The performance turned out to be dreadfully tedious, leaving me to wonder if it was truly the show or simply my own dismal state of mind.""",1
"""Poirot nodded thoughtfully, like a man whose mind is made up. “So be it!” he said. “Then I shall speak on your behalf.” Alfred Inglethorp jumped up once more. “You? How can you speak? You do not know,” he stopped abruptly. Poirot turned to address us. “Ladies and gentlemen! I declare! Hear me! I, Hercule Poirot, state that the individual who entered the pharmacy, and bought strychnine at six o’clock on Monday last was not Mr. Inglethorp, as at six o’clock on that day Mr. Inglethorp was accompanying Mrs. Raikes back to her residence from a nearby farm.""",1

"Jewels, cash, and bearer bonds all meticulously laid out, but for whom? Monsieur Davenheim, a man who always put himself first. It was clear - he had orchestrated it all for his own benefit. His recent obsession with buying jewelry made it all too easy. The money he had stolen was transformed into gems, likely substituted with fake copies, and stashed away under a different identity. A sizable fortune awaiting him, hidden until the coast was clear.",1
"""Is that so?"" ""Come now, Poirot, you don't expect me to abandon you in the face of the 'Big Four,' do you?"" Poirot silently agreed. ""Just what I thought. You're a true friend, Hastings.

"""Absolutely not; there was no chance of stumbling upon Hercule Poirot in a distant location. Upon reaching London, I checked in my bags at a hotel and immediately made my way to the familiar address. The flood of memories overwhelmed me! Without even pausing to greet my landlady, I sprinted up the stairs and knocked on Poirot's door with urgency. ""Come in,"" a recognizable voice called out. I entered the room. Poirot was standing there, holding a small suitcase in his arms. The suitcase fell to the ground with a thud as he caught sight of me. ""My friend, Hastings!"" he exclaimed. ""My friend, Hastings!""

From what I could gather, he remained unaware of our discovery of his charade. Perhaps he would return to dispose of the evidence, but Poirot dismissed my theory. ""My friend,"" he remarked, ""if you so desire, you may linger in anticipation like a cat waiting to pounce, but I do not squander my time in such a manner.""",1
"As I made my way to Villa Geneviève, my mood soured by the unsatisfactory turn of events, I opted for the solitude of the small bench near the shed. Lost in my thoughts, I was suddenly startled by the sound of approaching voices. It was not until the voices drew closer that I realized they were not from the garden I sat in, but from the neighboring Villa Marguerite. Amongst the voices, I distinguished the melodious tone of Marthe, the beautiful girl I knew all too well.",1
"Mrs. Middleton, the quiet housekeeper, had disappeared without a trace, leaving behind only her box of ordinary clothing. Mrs. Havering, her employer, had hired her through Selbourne’s Agency in Mount Street, but it turned out that no such woman had ever been registered with the agency. Poirot, the astute detective, quickly realized that Mrs. Middleton was just a clever disguise used by Mrs. Havering, an actress, to provide herself with an alibi during the murder of Mr. Harrington Pace. The truth unraveled as Poirot meticulously explained the sequence of events, revealing the hidden connections and deceptions that led to the crime.",1
"As the clock struck midnight, I found myself driving back to town, leaving my wife and uncle behind. Upon my return, a telegram was placed in my hand. It read: ""Uncle Harrington murdered last night. Bring a skilled detective. Hurry, Zoe."" With uncertainty clouding my mind, I made my way to Elmer's Dale, a desolate place surrounded by moors. The Scotland Yard inspector, Japp, greeted me with a grin, ready to share his findings. The housekeeper recounted the events of the night before, detailing the arrival of a mysterious man with a black beard. Mrs. Havering, a striking figure in her flame-colored attire, was eager to cooperate, her vivacious personality shining through the tragedy. The puzzle was set, and I was determined to unravel it.",1
"""I've considered every possible method of obtaining it,"" Tuppence went on. ""There are just three options! Inherit it, marry it, or earn it. The first is not an option. I don't have any wealthy elderly family members. The relatives I do have are residing in facilities for impoverished ladies! I constantly assist elderly women in crossing the street, and carry packages for elderly men, just in case they happen to be wealthy eccentrics. However, not a single one of them has ever inquired about my identity, and many of them have neglected to express their gratitude."" After a moment of silence, the conversation resumed.",1
"I never knew Ned's full name, if he even had one. When Harry arrived, soaking wet and dragging a dripping woman, Ned provided food and coffee, drying our clothes as we wrapped ourselves in bright Manchester blankets. Hidden in the hut, Ned went to find Sir Eustace's party, while I refused to go to Beira. Instead, I would join Suzanne and focus on my safety. The diamonds were to be deposited in Kimberley under the name Parker, with a code for messages. Ned signed off as ""Andy,"" ensuring genuine communication. My peace was short-lived, as Mrs. Blair barged in, worried about Anne's disappearance. Ignoring her dream, I asked about Race's whereabouts, refusing to take on all the worries of female companionship.",1
"""I will definitely assist you in any way I can,"" the young soldier responded. ""Unfortunately, I did not observe anything unusual. Maltravers was a family friend, but I did not know him well personally."" ""When did you arrive?"" ""On Tuesday afternoon. I left for London early Wednesday morning, my boat departing from Tilbury around noon. However, I had to change my plans due to some news I received, as I mentioned to Mrs. Maltravers."" ""You were heading back to East Africa, correct?"" ""That's right. I've been there since the War - it's a remarkable country."" ""Indeed.""",1
"“To uncover the truth behind his patient's demise, but a hemorrhage appears to be the likely cause. However, we must conduct further investigations. Get your bag ready in five minutes, Hastings, and we'll catch a taxi to Liverpool Street.” After an hour, we stepped off a train from the Great Eastern at the small Marsdon Leigh station. Gathering information there revealed that Marsdon Manor was approximately a mile away. Choosing to walk, Poirot and I proceeded down the main street. ""What's our strategy?"" I inquired.",1
"Then, as he approached the bedside, 'Fear not, Eloise,' he whispered. 'I will be back by morning.' Despite his attempt at reassurance, fear lingered in his gaze. They quickly escorted him out, the tall figure warning, 'A single noise and you're a dead man.' ""Following that,"" Mrs. Renauld recounted, ""I must have lost consciousness. The next memory I have is of Léonie massaging my hands and offering me brandy."" ""Madame Renauld,"" inquired the judge, ""did you have any inkling of what the intruders were seeking?"" ""None at all, sir."" ""Were you aware of any apprehensions your husband harbored?"" ""Indeed. I witnessed the transformation in him.""",1
"""I suggest you adjust your attitude, young lady."" I remained silent, letting out a small yawn that hinted at my boredom. ""What the heck,"" he started forcefully. But I cut him off. ""Yelling won't get you anywhere with me. Let's not waste time. I have no interest in speaking with subordinates. Take me directly to Sir Eustace Pedler to save us both time and trouble."" ""To?"" He seemed bewildered. ""Yes,"" I confirmed. ""Sir Eustace Pedler."" ""I I beg your pardon,"" He hurried out of the room like a startled hare. I took the opportunity to touch up my makeup in my purse.",1
"I met her eyes squarely. ""Nothing that you could tell me would be any surprise to me, Poirot. Understand that. But in case you think of resuming your search for Miss Duveen, I should like you to know one thing clearly. If you have any idea that she was concerned in the crime, or was the mysterious lady who called upon Mr. Renauld that night, you are wrong. I travelled home from France with her that day, and parted from her at Victoria that evening so that it is clearly impossible for her to have been in Merlinville.""",1
"""Madame, may I?"" He accepted the jewel, examining it closely before handing it back with a nod. ""A truly flawless gem. Ah, heavens! And to think you carry it with you, like this!"" ""No, no, I am very cautious, Monsieur Poirot. Normally, it is secured in my jewel case, kept in the hotel safe. We are staying at the Luxurious, you see. I only brought it today for your inspection."" ""And you will entrust it to me, will you not? You will heed the advice of Papa Poirot?"" ""Well, you see, Monsieur Poirot, it's like this.""",1
"""But the real question is whether he actually revealed his secret to her. The examining magistrate is optimistic, but I have my doubts.” As we strolled along the path leading to the intersection where our car had broken down earlier, it suddenly struck me that the Villa Marguerite, the residence of the enigmatic Madame Daubreuil, was the same quaint cottage where the lovely young woman had appeared. “She has resided here for quite some time,” remarked the commissary, gesturing towards the dwelling. “Very discreetly, without drawing any attention. It appears she has no family or close companions aside from the people she knows in Merlinville.""",1
"I arrived at the Villa Medgee after a challenging search. The people arrived on the waves on short curved boards. It was too early for tea, so I headed to the bathing pavilion. When offered a surf board, I eagerly accepted. Surfing seemed simple at first glance, but I quickly learned otherwise. Despite my initial frustration, I was determined to try again. Eventually, I caught a good wave and felt pure joy. Surfing has a way of bringing out strong emotions. Whether cursing vigorously or feeling foolishly proud, the experience is always intense.",1
"""At the time, the letter, despite being on stamped notepaper, seemed like it could have originated from anywhere. Maybe even Wales?"" The witness acknowledged the possibility, and Sir Ernest expressed his contentment. Elizabeth Wells, the second housemaid at Styles, recounted that she had bolted the front door instead of leaving it on the latch as Mr. Inglethorp had asked. Realizing her mistake after going to bed, she went back downstairs to fix it. Upon hearing a faint noise in the West wing, she peeked down the passage and spotted Mr. John Cavendish knocking on Mrs. Inglethorp's door.",1
"""Jane stared at Tuppence, her expression filled with confusion. ""What's the plan?"" she demanded, her tone sharp and unwavering. ""No room for mistakes, Miss Tuppence. We must proceed with certainty."" Tuppence, unusually at a loss for words, hesitated. ""It's so risky, you see. If I make a mistake, it could have dire consequences."" She shot a meaningful look at Jane, who remained oblivious. ""You won't forgive me,"" she hinted mysteriously. ""You need my assistance, correct?"" ""Yes, please. You're familiar with Mr. Brown, aren't you?"" ""Yes,"" Sir James replied seriously. ""I finally have a clear picture."" ""Finally?"" Tuppence questioned skeptically. ""Oh, but I thought..."" She trailed off.",1
"They arrived at the spot shortly after departing the city. Tommy brought the car to a sudden stop, casually inquiring about the path to the sea. Satisfied with the answer, he generously compensated the man. Moments later, the taxi disappeared into the distance towards Holyhead. Tommy and Julius observed its departure before turning towards the narrow path. ""This is the correct one, right?"" Tommy asked hesitantly. ""There seem to be plenty around here."" ""Yes, it is. Just look at the gorse. Remember what Jane mentioned?"" Tommy gazed at the blooming golden hedges that lined the path, confirming their choice. In single file, they descended, with Julius at the front.",1
"As he took a step back, he seemed to involuntarily retreat from an unseen threat, unaware that he was teetering on the edge of the platform. In an instant, he tumbled over the side. A bright flash emanated from the tracks followed by a sharp crackling noise, prompting a scream to escape my lips. The commotion drew a crowd as two station employees swiftly appeared, assuming control of the situation. I stood frozen in place, held captive by a chilling sense of intrigue.",1
"The overwhelming dread, momentarily set aside by the thrill of Jane Finn's discovery, came crashing back down on him. The attorney abruptly set down his utensils. ""Has something occurred to Miss Tuppence?"" His tone was sharp. ""She's vanished,"" Julius stated. ""When?"" ""Seven days prior."" ""In what manner?"" Sir James's inquiries were rapid-fire. Tommy and Julius recounted the events of the past week and their fruitless quest. Sir James immediately delved into the heart of the issue. ""A telegram bearing your signature? They possessed sufficient knowledge of both of you to pull that off.",1
"The cocoa remained untouched, too risky to handle with all the eyes watching her every move. A wave of relief washed over her as the word ""strychnine"" was mentioned, absolving her of any blame for the tragedy. ""The delay in the symptoms of strychnine poisoning makes sense now,"" Poirot explained, ""a narcotic can slow down the effects for hours."" Pausing for a moment, Mary met Poirot's gaze, feeling the heat of embarrassment creeping up her cheeks. ""Everything you've said is true,"" she admitted, ""it was the most horrifying moment of my life.""",1
"""Thank goodness I don't share your love for crime! What's the time? Let's grab some lunch, okay!"" The same idea crossed their minds simultaneously. Tommy was the first to speak it out loud. ""Julius P. Hersheimmer!"" ""We forgot to update Mr. Carter about our conversation with him."" ""Well, there wasn't much to say until we actually meet him. Come on, let's grab a cab."" ""Now who's being extravagant?"" ""Remember, all expenses covered. Get in."" ""Either way, we'll make a better impression arriving in this manner,"" Tuppence remarked, settling back comfortably. ""I highly doubt blackmailers choose to arrive by bus!"" ""We're no longer in the blackmail business,"" Tommy pointed out.",1
"Bex, a wrist watch knocked off the dressing-table by the assassins, without a doubt, and smashed to pieces. They had no idea it would incriminate them. Carefully, he removed the shattered glass fragments. Suddenly, his expression shifted to complete shock. ""Oh my God!"" he exclaimed. ""What's wrong?"" ""The watch hands are pointing to seven o’clock!"" ""Impossible!"" exclaimed the magistrate, surprised. But Poirot, as skillful as always, took the broken trinket from the startled commissary and listened closely. Then, he grinned. ""The glass may be shattered, but the watch is still ticking."" The mystery's solution was met with a sigh of relief.",1
"Details regarding your previous life in England may prove to be more challenging to maintain. Indeed, I believe that would be a preferable course of action. ""Hold on, Mr. Whittington! It appears you are assuming my agreement."" Whittington appeared taken aback. ""Surely you are not considering declining? I can assure you that Madame Colombier's is a highly reputable and conventional establishment. And the terms are quite generous."" ""Precisely,"" Tuppence remarked. ""That's the issue. The terms are almost excessively generous, Mr. Whittington. I fail to see how I could possibly be of that much value to you.""",1
"""The Big Four might have planted it,"" I suggested. Poirot shook his head. ""Think, Hastings. If they wanted to deceive you, they would have made sure the Chinaman spoke understandable pigeon English. No, the message was real. Recount what you heard."" I thought back. ""He mentioned Handel's Largo, and then something about a 'carrozzo' which means carriage, right?"" Poirot pressed for more. ""And at the end, he whispered 'Cara' followed by a woman's name.""",1
"""Oh!” said Tommy mechanically. He felt dazed. Julius’s words were totally unexpected. For the moment they benumbed his brain. “I’d like to tell you,” continued Julius, “that before I suggested anything of the kind to Miss Tuppence, I made it clear that I didn’t want to butt in in any way between her and you.” Tommy roused himself. “That’s all right,” he said quickly. “Tuppence and I have been pals for years. Nothing more.” He lit a cigarette with a hand that shook ever so little. “That’s quite all right. Tuppence always said that she was looking out for ” He stopped abruptly, his face crimsoning, but Julius was in no way discomposed. “Oh, I guess it’ll be the dollars that’ll do the trick.",1
"""He didn't immediately recognize her, but when he did, his admiration knew no bounds. 'Wouldn't have guessed it was you! That outfit is top-notch.' 'Glad you approve, Albert,' Tuppence replied modestly. 'By the way, am I your cousin or not?' 'Your voice as well,' exclaimed the delighted boy. 'It's as English as can be! No, I mentioned to a friend that I knew a young girl. Annie wasn't too happy. She stayed on until today to help out, she claimed, but really it was to turn you against the place.' 'Lovely girl,' Tuppence remarked. Albert didn't catch the sarcasm. 'She's quite fashionable and takes good care of her belongings, but boy, does she have a temper.'""",1
"He gazed at me intently, a sly grin forming on his face. 'Ah!' he exclaimed. 'Looks like our young friend is waking up once more. Excellent. Excellent.' I went through my usual routine. 'What's going on?' I asked. 'Where am I?' Though I already knew the answer to the latter. My mind is as sharp as ever. 'I believe that will suffice for now, sister,' the small man remarked, prompting the nurse to exit the room with practiced efficiency. However, I couldn't help but notice the lingering curiosity in her eyes as she made her departure. That curious gaze sparked an idea.",1
"I couldn’t tell if it was a letter or just a piece of paper, but it definitely had words on it. She was fixated on it, almost like she couldn’t believe what was written. Softly to herself, almost forgetting I was there, she murmured, ‘These few words and everything changes.’ Then, looking at me, she warned, ‘Never trust a man, Dorcas, they’re all the same!’ I quickly made her a strong cup of tea, which she appreciated, saying it would make her feel better. ‘I’m lost,’ she confided. ‘Infidelity between partners is a terrible thing, Dorcas.’",1
"‘Is it possible for a man to shoot himself like this? Show me,’ he demands. Reluctantly, the foolish man obliges, placing the rifle in his mouth. She crouches, playfully touching the trigger, a mischievous smile on her face. ‘Well, sir,’ she teases, ‘what if I were to pull it?’ “And just like that, Hastings, she does!” In my documented cases, Poirot always begins with a central fact - murder or theft - and cleverly unravels the mystery through logical deduction.",1
"It seemed like a veiled attempt to motivate Julius to continue his search for Tommy, though she probably didn't intend it that way. Tuppence was truly one of a kind. When he laid eyes on her, his train of thought came to a sudden halt. ""True,"" he replied, composing himself, ""there's no clue here about her plans. Hey Henry!"" The young boy approached promptly. Tommy handed over five shillings. ""Just one more thing. Do you recall what the young lady did with the telegram?"" Henry gasped and replied. ""She crumpled it into a ball, tossed it into the fireplace, and let out a noise like 'Whoop!' sir."" ""Quite the visual, Henry,"" remarked Tommy.",1
"""Mrs. Inglethorp mentioned something, I can't recall the exact words, about causing a scandal between a husband and wife."" The Coroner nodded in satisfaction. ""That aligns with what Dorcas overheard. But tell me, Mrs. Cavendish, even though you knew it was a private discussion, you didn't walk away? You stayed right there?"" I glimpsed a flash of her amber eyes as she looked up. I was certain that she was on the verge of tearing the smug little lawyer apart, but she responded calmly: ""No. I was quite content where I was.""",1
"Not until I reached the pier, after enduring the tedious formalities demanded by bureaucratic red tape, could I finally relax. No one had been arrested, and as I basked in the glorious weather, my hunger became apparent. Suzanne and I would be spending the night at the hotel. The boat wasn't departing for Port Elizabeth and Durban until the next morning. We hailed a taxi and headed to the Mount Nelson. The day was absolutely delightful - the sun, the breeze, the blooming flowers! Compared to the dreary January days in Little Hampsly, with its muddy terrain and constant rain, I couldn't help but revel in my current surroundings.",1
"The retired doctor, no longer in practice but still seeing a few private patients, was a popular and affable figure in the village. He had been there for at least a decade, known for his scientific expertise and the frequent visits from professors and others from town. Despite the lively atmosphere and constant stream of visitors, Tommy couldn't shake his lingering doubts.",1
"""Eight years he's been by my side, a loyal companion indeed,"" my acquaintance grinned. ""But we seem to be talking past each other. I'm talking about the woman."" ""Miss Pettigrew?"" I gasped. ""Yes. Reports have her exiting Agrasato’s Native Curio-shop,"" he disclosed. ""Good Lord!"" I interjected. ""I was heading there myself this very afternoon. You could have easily caught me leaving!"" It seems in Jo'burg, no innocent action goes unquestioned. ""But she's been spotted there multiple times, always under questionable circumstances.""",1
"""To-night, go to bed as usual, have no fears, and leave everything to me. But not a word to anyone, especially not to your two assistants Mademoiselle Claude and Monsieur Henri,"" Poirot instructed before leaving the villa, hands rubbing in satisfaction. ""What's the plan now?"" I inquired. ""We are departing Paris for England,"" Poirot responded. ""But the radium?"" I questioned. ""I never mentioned arriving in England, Hastings. Think about it, we're being watched and followed,"" Poirot explained, preparing to leave for the Gare du Nord after packing our belongings and having lunch.",1
"""Tell me, Moosior Poirot, why did he refuse? He wanted to avoid the spotlight. Didn't want anyone following his trail. That's what happened, Gilmour Wilson was mistakenly targeted."" ""Is there anyone with a personal motive for Savaronoff's death?"" ""Perhaps his niece. He recently inherited a large fortune from Madame Gospoja, whose husband profited from sugar in the past. There were rumors of an affair between them, and she never believed he was dead."" ""Where did the incident occur?"" ""In Savaronoff's apartment.""",1
"""Inspector Japp, C.I.D. Scotland Yard again. Another man this time. What does he expect I can tell him that I didn’t tell the first chap? I hope they haven’t lost that photograph. That Western photographer’s place was burned down and all his negatives destroyed this is the only copy in existence. I got it from the principal of the college there.” Tuppence felt a sudden wave of unease. “You you don’t know the name of the man who came this morning?” “Yes, I do. No, I don’t. Half a second. It was on his card. Oh, I know! Inspector Brown. Quiet, unassuming sort of chap.",1
"""Saw you in France when I was with the Intelligence. As soon as you entered the room, I knew it was you,"" Mr. Carter gestured to stop any mention of names. ""I go by Mr. Carter here. My cousin owns this house and allows me to use it for off-the-books work. So, who will start the story?"" Tommy prompted Tuppence to share. ""Go on, Tuppence, it's your tale,"" he urged. Tuppence proceeded to recount the story from the establishment of the Young Adventurers, Ltd.",1
"I'll be curious to see if the tools are from the Mousterian period. There will likely be remains of the primitive ox, but probably not of the woolly rhinoceros. A small group will be leaving soon. We need to stay ahead of them. Will you send a letter to Cook’s today, Anne?” “What about finances, dad?” I asked subtly. He gave me a disapproving look. “Your perspective always brings me down, my dear. We mustn't be materialistic. No, no, one mustn't be materialistic in the pursuit of knowledge.” “I have a feeling Cook’s might be materialistic, dad.” Dad looked hurt. “My dear Anne, you will settle the bill with cash.”",1
"""Renauld. This case has been one of the most perplexing and baffling mysteries to crack. Someone like Giraud, who doesn't rely on psychology, is bound to come up short."" ""You're truly amazing, Poirot,"" I expressed with awe. ""Absolutely amazing. No one else could have pulled it off like you did!""I could tell my admiration made him happy. For once, he seemed almost bashful. ""So, you no longer look down on poor old Papa Poirot? You're back to supporting me instead of the human foxhound?"" His nickname for Giraud always brought a smile to my face. ""Absolutely.""",1
"""I'm not so sure,"" Tuppence remarked. When they asked for Mr. Hersheimmer, they were immediately escorted to his room. In response to the page-boy's knock, an impatient voice called out ""Enter,"" and the boy stepped aside to let them through. Mr. Julius P. Hersheimmer appeared much younger than Tommy and Tuppence had imagined. The woman guessed he was around thirty-five years old. He was of average height, with a jawline that matched his sturdy build. His face had a tough but friendly look. It was clear he was American, despite his slight lack of accent.",1
"If Inglethorp had only intended to talk to them, she probably would have stayed by the window, and they wouldn't have entered the room. It was clear to me that she had created a new will and had asked the two gardeners to witness it. The outcome showed that my assumption was correct."" ""That was quite clever,"" I had to acknowledge. ""I have to admit, the conclusions I made from those few hasty words were completely wrong."" He grinned. ""You let your imagination run wild. Imagination is useful, but it can also mislead. The most straightforward explanation is usually the right one.""",1
"“Listen up, Tuppence, my dear, where is this all heading?” “More cash,” his partner responded. “I get that. Your mind is fixed on money. What I’m asking is, what comes next? How will you maintain this charade?” “Oh!” Tuppence paused, setting down her spoon. “You raise a valid point, Tommy.” “Let’s face it, you can’t deceive him indefinitely. Sooner or later, you’ll make a mistake. And honestly, I’m starting to think this could be considered blackmail.” “Rubbish. Blackmail is threatening to expose secrets for money. But I have no secrets to reveal.”",1
"As soon as Poirot caught sight of me, he seemed to relax. I pulled him aside and whispered, “Is this really the best course of action? Do you want everyone in the house to be aware of what just happened? You're only helping the criminal by doing so.” Poirot considered my words carefully. “You believe so, Hastings?” “I am certain of it.” Poirot's expression fell, and he looked sheepish. Despite feeling a twinge of pity, I knew my advice was sound. “Shall we leave, my friend?” he asked reluctantly. “Are you done investigating here?” I inquired. “For now, yes. Will you accompany me back to the village?” Poirot requested. “Of course,” I replied.",1
"“I am pleased with you. Go now and rest yourself. Hastings here and I have work to do. You shall see him tomorrow.” “Where are you going?” asked the girl, her eyes widening. “You shall hear all about it tomorrow.” “Because wherever you’re going, I’m coming too.” “But mademoiselle ” “I’m coming too, I tell you.” Poirot realized that it was futile to argue further. He gave in. “Come then, mademoiselle. But it will not be amusing. In all probability nothing will happen.” The girl made no reply. Twenty minutes later we set forth. It was quite dark now, a close, oppressive evening.",1
"“Yes, that is so,” she replied, her face visibly paling at the memory. The boudoir window had been wide open that evening, allowing the heated voices inside to carry outside. She had been sitting on the bench just outside, engrossed in her book but unable to ignore the escalating argument. It was clear that the commotion had not gone unnoticed by her, despite the attempt to focus on her reading.",1
"""I heard Colonel Race is heading to Rhodesia as well,” Suzanne remarked, deep in thought. “If we could somehow get Sir Eustace to extend an invitation to him too.” “You can make it happen. You have a way with things,” I replied. “I adore butter,” Suzanne purred with a mischievous twinkle in her eye. We concluded our conversation with the understanding that Suzanne would utilize her skills to their fullest potential. Feeling too restless to retire for the night, I made my way up to the deck. Tomorrow morning, we would reach Table Bay. The breeze was invigorating, the boat gently swaying in the choppy waters. The deck was shrouded in darkness, devoid of any souls.",1
"As the young man ran tirelessly through the labyrinth of London streets, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched. With each turn, he feared running into an official who would demand an explanation for his haste. Suddenly, a taxi appeared, its flag waving in the wind. Holding his breath, he waited to see if they would stop it. Thankfully, they let it go by without interference, allowing him to breathe a sigh of relief.",1
"In a single cunning move, the blackmailed individual not only eliminated the blackmailer, but also cleverly framed another unsuspecting victim for the crime. The unmistakable mark of the notorious 'Colonel' was evident in the scheme. Once again, I found myself ensnared in his web of deception. How foolish I was to have fallen into the trap so effortlessly. Disoriented, I exited the scene, trying to maintain a facade of composure, knowing that it was only a matter of time before the truth would surface and my identity would be broadcast far and wide.",1
"""That appeared to rattle him quite a bit, and he mentioned that having a wife was extremely beneficial for a General Practitioner. The notion seemed even less romantic than previously, however there was a part of me that leaned towards agreeing to it. Security, that was what was being offered to me. Security and a Cozy Residence. Reflecting on it now, I think I misjudged the little man. He truly loved me, but a misguided sense of propriety held him back from pursuing me in that way. Nevertheless, my affection for adventure resisted. ""It's incredibly generous of you,"" I responded. ""But it's not feasible. I could never wed a man unless I was passionately in love with him.""",1
"He seated me in a chair, as he meticulously groomed himself. I recounted every detail, withholding nothing - from my awakening to Mrs. Inglethorp's last words, her husband's disappearance, the previous day's argument, the snippet of conversation between Mary and her mother-in-law, the past dispute between Mrs. Inglethorp and Evelyn Howard, and the suspicions cast by the latter. My narrative was somewhat muddled, with repetition and the occasional backtrack to fill in missed details.",1
"""The insurance policy, that's what this is about, correct? But why must I deal with this now?"" ""Stay strong, Madame. Stay strong! Your husband had a substantial life insurance policy, so the Company needs to verify some information. They've given me the authority to represent them. I promise to make this process as painless as possible for you. Can you please tell me what happened on Wednesday?"" ""I was getting ready for tea when my maid informed me that one of the gardeners had urgently come to the house.""",1
"I have always been skilled at creating a mysterious atmosphere. The dark, melancholic face before me remained unchanged as I delivered the cryptic message: ""Find the additional coffee cup, and find peace."" Lawrence's expression shifted to genuine bewilderment. ""What does this mean?"" he asked. I, too, was at a loss. ""Who could the extra coffee cup belong to?"" The answer remained elusive. Lawrence suggested seeking out Dorcas or one of the maids for answers regarding the mysterious coffee cups.",1
"""Tell me your thoughts,"" Poirot said with a smile, puffing out his chest. ""If we consider murder, the question that arises is why that specific method was chosen. The only reason I can think of is to conceal identity, with the face burned beyond recognition.""  ""What?"" I exclaimed.  ""Wait a moment, Hastings. I was about to mention that I will investigate this theory. Is there any reason to suspect that the body does not belong to Mr. Paynter? Is there someone else it could be? I will explore these questions and ultimately answer both with a no.""",1
"Honestly, I despise early humans, whether they be Aurignacian, Mousterian, Chellian, or any other kind. Despite working on Papa's book about Neanderthal Man and his Ancestors, I can't help but feel repulsed by Neanderthal men themselves. It's a relief that they went extinct so long ago. I doubt Papa ever realized my true feelings, and even if he did, he wouldn't have cared. He was never concerned with the opinions of others, which I believe was a testament to his greatness. Similarly, he lived completely removed from the mundane aspects of everyday life.",1
"I took the envelope from her hand as we said our goodbyes. Inside, five brand new five-pound notes greeted me along with a note that read: “I hope you will not be offended and will accept this with my love.” Despite our differences, she truly was a kind woman. With twenty-five pounds in my pocket, I was ready to embark on my journey into the unknown. It wasn't until the fourth day that the stewardess convinced me to venture up on deck. I had believed staying below would hasten my demise, but I was slowly coming to realize the error in my thinking.",1
"We said our goodbyes. His departing words were, ‘You pride yourself on your intelligence, my dear,’ he stated. ‘I may not have a formal education, but nevertheless, I am willing to match wits with you anytime. Time will reveal who the victor will be.’ “That was nearly a decade ago. I would occasionally visit him for a weekend, and although we got along well, his beliefs never wavered. He never brought up my academic achievements, whether it be my matriculation or my B.Sc. Over the last three years, his health had been deteriorating, and a month ago he passed away. “I have now arrived at the reason for my presence. My uncle’s will is quite peculiar.",1
"I didn't notice it when I took the tray up, but as I carried it into the mistress's room, I spotted it immediately. I probably should have brought it back down and asked cook to prepare a fresh one. However, with Dorcas absent, I was pressed for time. I convinced myself that the cocoa was still safe, and only the tray had been affected by the salt. Hastily, I wiped it off with my apron and delivered it to her room.   My heart raced with excitement as I struggled to maintain my composure. Little did Annie realize, she had unknowingly given us a crucial piece of evidence. If only she knew that her ""coarse kitchen salt"" was actually strychnine, one of the deadliest poisons known to man.",1
"""You concur with me, don't you, Mr. Crowther?"" The Secretary of State hesitated before responding. ""Honestly, I'm not sure,"" he finally admitted. ""I've always had, and still maintain, complete faith in M. Poirot, but, well, this is a lot to take in.""  ""M. Desjardeaux brought up Li Chang Yen,"" he continued. ""But who is he, really?"" ""I know,"" unexpectedly interjected Mr. Ingles. The Frenchman turned to look at him, and Mr. Ingles returned the gaze calmly, resembling a Chinese figurine. ""Mr. Ingles,"" the Secretary of State clarified, ""is our foremost expert on the Chinese mainland.""",1
"""It's a big deal! It's huge!"" ""Yes"" ""Oh!"" Poirot pointed his finger at me so aggressively that I trembled. ""Watch out! Danger for the detective who says, 'It's so insignificant, it doesn't matter. It won't make a difference. I'll overlook it.' That path leads to chaos! Everything is important."" ""I understand. You always emphasized that to me. That's why I have delved into all the intricacies of this matter, whether they seemed pertinent to me or not."" ""And I am impressed with you. You have a great memory, and you have presented the information accurately.""",1
"I knew Ridgeway wouldn't have returned yet. I quickly found someone and brought him back. ""He's dead, poor chap. Tramp you've been helping, huh?"" ""Something like that,"" Poirot said vaguely. ""What was the cause of death, doctor?"" ""Hard to tell. Could have been some sort of seizure. Signs of asphyxiation. No gas supply, right?"" ""No, just electric light."" ""Both windows wide open. Been dead for about two hours. Will you inform the authorities?"" He left. Poirot made some calls. Surprisingly, he called Inspector Japp and asked him to come over.",1
"Mr. Poirot and I were waiting in the hotel room of the Opalsens. Mrs. Opalsen was weeping, her pearls missing. Mr. Opalsen paced angrily, while two police officials stood by. The chambermaid and the French maid were also present, both in distress. Mrs. Opalsen believed in luck, convinced that Poirot was the one to find her pearls. Poirot reassured her, promising to help. Mrs. Opalsen then recounted how she found her jewel-case empty after dinner, despite the room being locked and her maid present. The inspector suggested a duplicate key was used. Célestine, the maid, was horrified at the implication and turned to Poirot for help, disregarding the police's incompetence.",1
"""Urgent matter. Yours faithfully, P. T. RENAULD."" A barely legible plea followed the signature: ""For God’s sake, come!"" Returning the letter, I felt a surge of anticipation. ""Finally, something unusual,"" I remarked. ""Absolutely,"" Poirot concurred thoughtfully. ""You will be going, correct?"" I asked. Poirot nodded, deep in thought. After a moment, he made a decision and checked the time. His expression was serious. ""Time is of the essence. The Continental express departs Victoria at 11 o’clock. No need to fret, we have ample time. Let's take ten minutes to discuss.""",1
"""Tell us, Miss Tuppence, about your escapades,"" Sir James inquired. With a sense of pride, Tuppence recounted her adventures, while Julius chimed in with occasional words of admiration. Sir James waited until she had finished, then calmly praised her efforts. ""There's one thing I can't quite figure out,"" Julius remarked. ""What prompted her sudden departure?"" Tuppence admitted, ""I'm not sure."" Sir James pondered the chaotic state of the room. ""It seems her escape was unplanned,"" he concluded.",1
"""Make haste to the Trade Commissioner’s Office, the Board of Agriculture, or the Chamber of Mines. Request the loan of a woman with captivating eyes, amenable to hand-holding,” instructed Sir Eustace. The secretary nodded, “A skilled short-hand-typist shall be sought.” Sir Eustace scowled, “Pagett is vexing. He'll likely select a displeasing woman to vex me further. Don't forget, she must possess dainty feet.” Excitedly, I grasped Suzanne's hand and led her to her quarters. ""Suzanne, time is of the essence. We must devise our plans swiftly.""",1
"It was completely dark, but Lawrence held a flickering candle as we entered the room. The unmade bed suggested it had not been slept in, and the lack of any personal items added to the mystery. Approaching the connecting door, we found it locked from the inside. Panic set in as we debated our next move. ""What on earth should we do now?"" Dorcas exclaimed anxiously. ""I suppose we'll have to force our way through,"" I responded. ""It won't be easy. Send one of the maids to fetch Baily and Dr. Wilkins immediately. Let's give this door a shot.""",1
"""I can't forget the way Claudie used to play with his food, always picking at his bread during meals. It's like he had to gather every last crumb on the table. That habit of his is etched in my memory. I could spot him from a mile away just by watching him do that."" ""Exactly my point! Your attention to detail is truly remarkable. Did you ever confront him about this peculiar behavior, miss?"" ""No, I never did, Detective. Men can be so touchy about these things! They hate being called out, especially by a woman.""",1
"I'm keeping a close watch on the house, unwilling to leave. I'll remain here until six o'clock, and if you haven't arrived by then, I'll attempt to enter the house by myself. It's an opportunity too valuable to pass up, and there's a chance the boy won't locate you. However, if he does, have him escort you down here immediately. Make sure to conceal those distinctive moustaches of yours in case someone is observing from the house and could identify you. ""Yours urgently, ""A. H."" Each word I penned dragged me further into hopelessness. The scheme was devilishly cunning.",1
"And I stumbled upon a brilliant young Chinese chemist who was willing to share his story. He appeared at my doorstep one day, clearly on the brink of a nervous collapse. The chemist hinted at disturbing experiments he had conducted in Li Chang Yen's palace under the mandarin's orders, experiments that involved cruelty towards coolies. His mental state was shattered, consumed by fear and despair.",1
"“I’m afraid I can’t say exactly how much,” she hesitated. “We do have enough for now, but if we need more…” “It will be ready for you,” he assured her. “Good, good. I just hope I don’t offend the authorities by saying this, but it can be quite a hassle to get anything from them! The forms, the waiting, the back and forth. It’s all so tedious,” she complained. Mr. Reynolds chuckled. “Don’t fret, my dear. Just send me a direct request, and the cash will be in your hands in no time.”",1
"The individuals responsible for packing the items have described them as having a unique and challenging shape, requiring custom-made cases. Mrs. Blair has been made aware that transporting these items home will come at a high cost. Meanwhile, Pagett is eager to reunite with me in Jo’burg, but I plan to keep him in Cape Town under the guise of overseeing Mrs. Blair's cases. I have instructed Pagett to ensure the safe handling of the cases, emphasizing the rare and valuable contents. With everything settled, Miss Pettigrew and I embark on our journey together, which, to any observer, appears entirely above board.",1
"I prayed for your safety, my friend, as I sensed you venturing into dangerous territory."" With trepidation, I arrived at the Savoy at the designated time set by Mr. Ryland, seeking an audience with the esteemed figure. After a brief wait, I was escorted to his chambers. Ryland sat at a desk, a letter from the Home Secretary spread out before him. It was my initial encounter with the wealthy American, and despite my efforts, I couldn't help but be struck by his presence. Towering and gaunt, he possessed a protruding chin and a nose that curved slightly. His cold, gray eyes gleamed from under prominent brows.",1
"Carton and She had arranged to meet at the location, pretending that their encounter was by chance. They were both there to see the same house and had taken measures to avoid being tracked. Little did Carton know, the person following him was the mysterious 'Man in the Brown Suit.' The shock of this realization caused Carton to panic and make a fatal misstep. Does this all make sense to you, Anne?"" Anne remained silent. ""That's the gist of it. Carton obtained a document from the deceased individual, but in his haste to escape, he accidentally dropped it. He then trailed the woman all the way to Marlow.",1
"After confirming the girl's identity as Whittington's niece, I couldn't help but wonder if her cuteness would foil my plan. Nevertheless, I took the risk. I quickly sent a wire to Beresford, feigning a sprained foot and urging him to visit if he could. Despite my caution in the message, there was no response. Thankfully, my foot healed swiftly, and I bid farewell to the doctor, asking him to notify me of any news from Nurse Edith. Returning to town, I noticed Tuppence's unusually pallid complexion. ""It's Tommy,"" she whispered.",1
"I heard his footsteps before I saw him, prompting me to proceed cautiously to avoid detection. Peering around a corner, I caught a glimpse of him pressing the doorbell and gaining entry into the residence. I paused in my tracks, the rain starting to drench me and the biting cold seeping into my bones. Time passed, but Whittington remained indoors. Restlessness took hold of me, prompting me to explore further. While the ground floor windows were securely closed, a flickering light emanated from an open window on the second floor, offering a potential clue.",1
"""Mr. Brown has a more refined approach. We need to fetch a doctor but first, is there anything valuable in this room?"" The trio hurriedly searched, finding a burnt pile in the fireplace where Mrs. Vandemeyer had been destroying papers before fleeing. Despite scouring the other rooms, nothing significant was discovered. ""Wait,"" exclaimed Tuppence suddenly, gesturing towards an old safe embedded in the wall. ""It's meant for jewelry, but there could be more inside."" With the key already in the lock, Julius opened the door and meticulously examined its contents, taking his time with the task.",1
"After respectfully pausing for a few moments to maintain the element of surprise, I delivered Lawrence's message to him. ""Ah!"" he exclaimed. ""So he discovered the additional coffee cup. Excellent. Monsieur Lawrence seems to possess more intelligence than one might assume based on his appearance."" I personally did not have a high opinion of Lawrence's intelligence, but I chose not to argue with Poirot. Instead, I gently reminded him of my instructions regarding Cynthia's days off. ""You are right. My memory is not the best. Nonetheless, the other young lady was quite understanding. She sympathized with my disappointment and graciously showed me around.""",1
"""Your enthusiasm will be our downfall, Albert. What was your message?"" ""Told her we were staying at the hotel. If she managed to escape, to meet us there and sing like a canary."" ""She will easily identify you,"" remarked Tommy, breathing a sigh of relief. ""Your mind tends to wander, Albert. You wouldn't even recognize a canary's song if you heard it."" Albert appeared dejected. ""Don't worry,"" reassured Tommy. ""No harm done. That waiter is an acquaintance of mine, I'm sure he recognized me, although he didn't show it. They don't want to raise suspicion. That's why we've had such smooth sailing.""",1
"""Mary’s voice was cool and liquid as she spoke: “Do you really have the right to judge my actions?” John retorted, “The village will be talking! My mother’s funeral was just last Saturday, and here you are gallivanting with that man.” Mary nonchalantly replied, “If it’s just village gossip that bothers you!” John persisted, “But it’s more than that. I can’t stand that man loitering around. He’s a Polish Jew, for God’s sake.” Mary calmly stated, “A touch of Jewish heritage never hurt anyone. It adds a spark to the otherwise dull Englishman.” Her eyes blazed with fire, her voice like ice. John blushed deeply. “Mary!” he exclaimed. “Yes?” Her tone remained unchanged, extinguishing any trace of pleading in his voice.",1
"Poirot and Hastings were deep in discussion, trying to unravel the mystery surrounding the murder of Mr. Renauld. As they debated various theories, Poirot suddenly paused and looked at Hastings with a glint in his eye. ""I have it,"" he exclaimed. ""The answer lies not in the open door, but in the closed window."" Hastings was taken aback by this revelation. ""The window?"" he asked, puzzled. ""Yes, the window,"" Poirot replied, his mind racing with possibilities. ""It is clear to me now that the murderer did not leave through the door, but through the window. That is where we will find our answers."" With a newfound determination, Poirot and Hastings set out to investigate the window, knowing that it held the key to solving the case.",1
"""I apologize for the inconvenience, madam. To make this process easier for you, I will ask questions and you may simply respond. When did you retire for the night yesterday?” “Around 9:30 pm, sir. I was quite fatigued.” “And your spouse?” “I believe he followed suit an hour later.” “Was he agitated or unsettled in any way?” “No, not noticeably.” “What transpired next?” “I was awoken by a hand covering my mouth. Despite my efforts to scream, it was futile. Two masked intruders were present.” “Can you provide a description of the suspects, madam?” “One was tall with a lengthy black beard, while the other was shorter and stout, with a reddish beard.”",1
"Halliday's findings and theories captivated me."" Poirot acknowledged before posing an unexpected query. ""Madame, where were these discussions held? In this room?"" ""No, monsieur. In the lab."" ""May I visit?"" ""Of course."" Leading the way to the entrance she had used, we passed through a small hallway. Walking through two doors, we arrived in the expansive laboratory, filled with various instruments and tools I couldn't identify. Two individuals were inside, engrossed in an experiment. Madame Olivier made the introductions. ""Mademoiselle Claude, one of my aides."" A tall, solemn young woman nodded in greeting.",1
"Poirot greeted all our acquaintances before diving into his investigation. Unlike Giraud, Poirot paid little attention to the room itself, focusing instead on the worn-out garments near the entrance. Giraud smirked at Poirot's seemingly lackadaisical approach, but Poirot quickly dismissed the clothing as belonging to the gardener. Kneeling beside the victim, Poirot meticulously inspected the fabric of the attire, ensuring there were no traces of evidence to be found.",1
"During the interrogation, the detective probed further. ""So you're claiming that you never once considered the possibility that the witnesses misidentified your voice as Mr. Smith's at the scene of the crime. Isn't that rather peculiar?"" ""Not at all. I was under the impression that my mother and Mr. Smith had a heated argument, so it seemed plausible to me."" ""Even after the maid Doris recounted specific parts of their exchange, parts that should have rung a bell?"" ""I didn't recall those details."" ""Seems like your memory is lacking."" ""Not really. We were both upset and likely spoke out of turn. I didn't pay much heed to the specifics of my mother's words.""",1
"He quickly snapped out of his daze and resumed his exploration. Retrieving a set of keys from the ground, he deftly spun them in his hand before settling on one that gleamed in the light. Testing it in the lock of a purple case, he successfully opened it. However, after a brief pause, he closed and locked it again, stashing the keys in his pocket. ""I don't have the permission to delve into these documents. But it can't wait!"" Moving on, he meticulously searched through the drawers of the wash-stand.",1
"“Yes, it’s a beautiful estate. It should rightfully be mine, if only my father had left a proper will. I wouldn’t be struggling financially like I am now.”   “Financially struggling, you say?”   “Yes, my dear Hastings, I must confess that I am in desperate need of money.”   “Can’t your brother offer assistance?”   “Lawrence? He’s wasted all his money on publishing terrible poetry in fancy covers. No, we are a poor family. My mother has always been kind to us, until recently. Since her marriage, that is,” he paused, looking troubled.",1
"""He frequently travels back and forth to Africa. It is rumored that he is involved in undercover operations, although the truth remains uncertain. He carries an air of mystery about him."" ""Perhaps he inherited a substantial fortune from Sir Laurence Eardsley?"" ""Ah, he must be quite wealthy. He would make a suitable match for you."" ""I can't pursue him while you're here,"" I joked. ""Ah, the complications of married women!"" ""We certainly have an advantage,"" Suzanne said smugly. ""Everyone knows my loyalty lies with my husband, Clarence. It's much safer and more enjoyable to court a devoted wife.""",1
"He always had a laughable lack of faith in my abilities. He was convinced I couldn't handle the danger and would swoop in to take control. But I had no choice but to comply. I followed his orders. My captor took the note, read it, then smiled and handed it to a silent attendant who vanished behind a silk curtain covering a doorway. The man across from me grinned, grabbed a cable form, and wrote a message. He passed it to me. It said: ""Set the white bird free immediately.",1
"All I could think was, 'What's the point?' My friend was gone, with no one left to mourn him. I was meant to be gone too, so let it be. Living a quiet life now, devoid of joy or sorrow, numbed to the core. Looking back, I realize the war played a part in that. ""But then, out of nowhere, something jolted me back to reality. Guiding a group onto my boat for a river trip, I stood at the dock assisting them when one of the passengers gasped in shock. It drew my gaze to him.""",1
"""Those detectives are relentless! I can't fathom their motives! They've combed through every inch of the house, leaving no stone unturned. It's truly outrageous! I suspect they seized the opportunity when we were all away. I'll have a word with that Japp fellow next time I cross paths with him!"" ""Nosy parkers,"" muttered Miss Howard. Lawrence suggested they were simply putting on a facade. Mary Cavendish remained silent. Later, I proposed to Cynthia that we take a stroll, and we wandered into the woods hand in hand.""",1
"""We abandoned her at Villa Marguerite, headed straight to Villa Geneviève, and yet she beat us there!"" ""No, we didn't actually leave her behind. She slipped out the back of Villa Marguerite while we were conversing with her mother in the entrance. That's how she managed to outsmart Hercule Poirot!"" ""But the shadow on the blind? We spotted it from the street."" ""Well, by the time we glanced up, Madame Daubreuil had swiftly ascended the stairs and positioned herself."" ""Madame Daubreuil?"" ""Indeed. One is elderly, the other youthful, one brunette, and the other blonde, but their silhouettes on the blind are remarkably similar for this purpose.""",1
"""The crime scene was meticulously staged to mislead investigators about the time of death. Madame Renauld, the examining magistrate, and everyone else accepted the initial timeline without question. However, Hercule Poirot, with his keen eye for detail, knew that the truth was being concealed. The doctors' examination of the body revealed that death had actually occurred much earlier than indicated at the crime scene. There was a deliberate effort to create a false narrative, but Poirot was determined to uncover the real timeline of events.""",1
"""I never suspected you to be a fool, my dear lady, but might I suggest that you are rather reckless? The 'Colonel' is not one to tolerate blackmail, you know."" ""I have no fear of him,"" she chuckled. ""There is only one man who has ever truly frightened me, and he's long gone."" The man regarded her with a curious expression. ""Let's hope he doesn't return from the dead,"" he quipped. ""What do you mean?"" the dancer demanded. The Count appeared taken aback. ""I simply meant that a resurrection would be inconvenient for you,"" he clarified. ""Just a silly jest."" She breathed a sigh of relief. ""Oh, no need to worry. He's definitely dead. Killed in the war.""",1
"The murderer who killed his victims by drowning them in their baths could have avoided detection if he had changed his methods. However, he stuck to what had worked before, leading to his downfall. Hercule Poirot, with his knowledge of the human mind, is determined to find the criminal behind the similar crimes. He points out the importance of the wristwatch gaining two hours after the tragedy and the absence of footprints in the flower bed, alluding to a deeper mystery. Just then, Gabriel Stonor, a well-traveled and imposing figure, enters the room, bringing a new energy to the investigation.",1
"”The heavy thud echoed from inside the room. Without hesitation, the key twisted in the lock and the door creaked open. Cinderella, visibly shaken, motioned for us to enter. “Is she unharmed?” Poirot inquired urgently. “Yes, I arrived just in time. She was barely conscious.” Mrs. Renauld lay on the bed, struggling for air. “She tried to strangle me,” she whispered through labored breaths. The young woman picked up an object from the ground and passed it to Poirot. It was a coiled silk rope ladder, delicate yet sturdy. “An escape plan,” Poirot concluded. “She intended to flee through the window while we forced the door. And the other?” The woman stepped back and silently pointed in response.”",1
"He used to be a beachcomber and a remittance man on various South Sea islands before coming back to New York two years ago, where he quickly spiraled downwards. What struck me the most was that he recently acquired enough money to travel to Egypt. ""I have a friend there who can lend me some,"" he confidently stated. However, his plans took a turn for the worse. He returned to New York, bitterly cursing his miserly uncle who valued ancient kings' bones more than his own family. It was while he was in Egypt that Sir John Willard met his demise.",1
"The burly man's firm hold renders me as defenseless as a mere infant. The situation is undeniably awkward and bordering on the absurd. Let us compose ourselves and remain composed."" ""You won't give chase?"" ""No, certainly not. Am I Giraud? Let go of me, my good man."" Keeping a wary gaze fixed on him, as I was well aware that I was no match for Poirot in terms of cunning, I loosened my grasp, and he eased into an armchair, rubbing his arms gently. ""You possess the strength of a bull when provoked, Hastings! Well, do you believe you have treated your old friend fairly? I present you with the girl's photograph and you recognize her, yet you remain silent.""",1
"“The rug by the fireplace is out of place,” he pointed out, pausing to adjust it. Suddenly, he straightened up with a gasp. Clutched in his hand was a tiny torn piece of paper. “Seems the French, much like the English, tend to neglect sweeping beneath the rugs!” Bex handed me the scrap, prompting me to take a closer look. “Does this ring a bell, Hastings?” I shook my head, feeling a sense of déjà vu with the pink hue of the paper. The inspector was quick to connect the dots. “A torn piece of a check,” he declared. The scrap was roughly two inches square, with the word “Duveen” inked onto it. “Good,” remarked Bex.",1
"Poirot pondered for a moment before speaking, ""The value of the diamond is significant. Greg sold it to you for far less than it is worth."" He paused, deep in thought. ""Hand me my almanac, Hastings,"" he requested. As I handed it to him, Poirot turned the pages, mumbling to himself. ""Ah, the full moon is on Friday next, in three days' time. Madame, I suggest you leave the diamond with me for safekeeping until then. This romantic tale may be a deception, but we cannot be certain. Let us wait until after Friday to decide our next move.""",1
"""The Big Four are not to be underestimated, my friend,"" Poirot warned. ""Their ambitions extend far beyond what most can comprehend."" Japp chuckled at Poirot's seriousness, but his laughter faded as Poirot continued. ""They possess a weapon unlike any other, a force of magnetical attraction that can wreak havoc on a grand scale."" Japp's smile disappeared as he realized the gravity of the situation. Poirot fixed him with a piercing gaze. ""Do not underestimate them, my friend. The Big Four are playing a dangerous game, and we are merely pawns in their twisted plot.""",1
"“Not a word was shared with me. We never had that kind of relationship. But he was clearly agitated and quite shaken!” “Interesting,” remarked Detective Jones. “Do you have any idea what might have caused this?” “As I mentioned before, I do not, sir.” “I’m sorry, but we must go through some formalities. What is your name?” “My name is Alexander Moretti.” “When did you start working as Mr. Renauld’s assistant?” “It was roughly two years back, right after his return from South America. I was introduced to him by a friend, and he offered me the job. He was an excellent boss, I must say.” “Did he share much about his life in South America with you?” “Yes, quite a bit actually.”",1
"After enduring a nerve-racking crisis, she found herself facing the sea, a place she dreaded. With the enemy drawing closer each day, the situation seemed dire. Fortunately, her practical husband came to the rescue, unphased by her distress. Upon reaching England, she was left weak but alive. Poirot, with a serious expression, pointed out a flaw in the toast rack, exclaiming his disapproval. As I attempted to explain the shape of the toast, he dismissed my words with sarcasm. Reflecting on the lack of interesting cases, Poirot opened his letters, finding mostly bills. A note from Japp brought a slight glimmer of hope, thanking him for assistance in a past case.",1
"The Kafir boy opened the door, gesturing for me to come in. Hesitating, I lingered in the dimly lit hall. Without a word, the man led me to another room. ""The young lady here to see Mr. Harry Rayburn,"" he announced with a chuckle. I entered. The room was bare, the air thick with the smell of stale tobacco. A man sat at a desk, scribbling away. He glanced up, surprised. ""Well, well, if it isn't Miss Beddingfeld,"" he remarked. ""I must be mistaken,"" I stammered. ""Are you Mr. Chichester, or perhaps Miss Pettigrew? You bear a striking resemblance to them both.""",1
"“You need me to look into his death?” “I need you to find out how much of the news is just gossip, and how much is actually true? Three deaths, Monsieur Poirot each one seemingly explainable on its own, but together such an incredible coincidence, all within a month of the tomb being opened! It might just be superstition, or perhaps a curse from the past that works in mysterious ways. Nevertheless, three deaths! And I am scared, Monsieur Poirot, very scared. This might not be over yet.” “Who are you worried about?” “My son.”",1
"Poirot flashed a kind smile at me. ""Is your mind in a muddle? Take your time, my friend. It's natural to be agitated and excited. When we're calmer, we'll sort the facts neatly, each in its place. We will analyze and discard. Important details will be set aside; unimportant ones, poof!"" he mimicked blowing them away with a comical expression on his cherubic face. ""That's all fine,"" I interjected, ""but how do you determine what's important and what's not? That's always the tricky part for me."" Poirot vigorously shook his head.",1
"""Did Renauld prevent Madame Daubreuil from leaving? Had she departed already?"" ""Yes, sir. I overheard them exiting the study and heading towards the door. Monsieur bid her good night and closed the door behind her."" ""At what time did this occur?"" ""Around twenty-five minutes past ten, sir."" ""Do you know when M. Renauld retired to bed?"" ""I heard him ascending the stairs about ten minutes after us. The stairs creak so loudly that one can hear every step taken."" ""And is that all? Did you hear any commotion during the night?"" ""Absolutely nothing, sir."" ""Who was the first servant to come downstairs in the morning?"" ""That would be me, sir.""",1
"“No one’s appetite is better than yours, Tuppence. You would be eating everything by tea-time. But, really, I don’t think the idea is good. Whittington might not even be in London.” “True. I believe clue No. 2 holds more promise.” “Let’s hear it.” “It’s simple. Just the Christian name Rita. Whittington mentioned it that day.” “Are you suggesting a third advertisement: Seeking a female criminal named Rita?” “No, I am not. I prefer to reason logically. Danvers was followed on the way here, right? It’s more likely to have been a woman than a man.” “I don’t agree with that at all.”",1
"Inglethorp's departure took place the following day. On Monday, at a late breakfast, John pulled me aside and shared that Mr. Inglethorp was leaving that morning. He would be staying at the Stylites Arms until his plans were finalized. John expressed relief at his departure, mentioning how it was difficult to believe he was guilty before. The situation now felt worse, with everyone feeling guilty for wrongly accusing him. John admitted they had treated him poorly, but justified their initial suspicions due to the incriminating evidence.",1
"In no way could I see any resemblance to young Templeton, James the footman, or any other personalities we had encountered. Yet, I was convinced this was none other than the infamous Number Four. His voice held a faint similarity to the buttoned-up-stranger from Paris. Unsure of what to do, he smiled and shook his head. ""I would not recommend it,"" he said. ""Recall the consequences of your swift actions in Paris. Rest assured, my escape route is secure.""",1
"Upon our return to London, my eyes were drawn to a striking foxhound figurine displayed proudly on Poirot's mantelpiece. Poirot confirmed my unspoken question with a nod. ""Ah, yes! I have received my 500 francs! Isn't he magnificent? I have christened him Giraud!"" A few days passed before Jack Renauld visited us, his countenance determined. ""M. Poirot, I bid you farewell. I am setting sail for South America imminently. My father had extensive business dealings on the continent, and I am eager to forge a new path there."" ""Will you be traveling alone, M. Jack?"" ""My mother accompanies me, and Stonor will remain as my secretary.""",1
"""It was positioned right in front of his face. The killer then left once more, making sure to open all the windows. Hydrocyanic acid is highly volatile, with a distinct scent of bitter almonds. Without any hint of the odor to assist them, and no inkling of foul play, the doctors would attribute the death to some natural cause. This man was part of the Secret Service, Hastings. And he vanished in Russia five years ago."" ""He has been in the Asylum for the past two years,"" I remarked. ""But what about the three years preceding that?"" Poirot shook his head, then suddenly grasped my arm. ""The clock, Hastings, look at the clock."" I followed his eyes to the mantelpiece. The clock had come to a halt at four o'clock.""",1
"""Much to my astonishment, Poirot repeated almost verbatim what he had told Bex the night before: “I must disagree with you. The door being left ajar was not by chance, but rather a deliberate choice or a pressing need. Any hypothesis that overlooks this fact is destined to fail.” We watched in disbelief as the little man held his ground. Despite revealing his ignorance regarding the match outcome earlier, he now appeared unfazed, confidently asserting his position to the esteemed Giraud.""",1
"I know. But there is still much to unravel in this twisted tale of deceit and danger. The truth lies in the shadows, waiting to be brought to light. And I will not rest until justice is served and the secrets are laid bare. The game is afoot, and I am ready to play my part in this deadly dance of deception and betrayal. Let the pieces fall where they may, for the truth will always prevail in the end. And I will be there to witness it all, standing tall in the face of danger and uncertainty. This is my story, and I will see it through to the very end. Let the truth be known, no matter the cost.",1
"""Have you witnessed it unequivocally? Take the four rogues, split them apart, one atop the deck, one beneath, and repeat the process, and there they reunite. That is my goal. I have been battling, at times against one of the Big Four, at times against another. Yet once I gather them all, akin to the four rogues in a deck of cards, I will eliminate them with one decisive move!"" ""And how do you plan to assemble them all?"" I inquired. ""By biding my time. By hiding until the critical moment arrives, when they are poised to strike.""",1
"The silence was eerie, broken only by the rumble of our car, a vintage Ford that looked like it had seen better days. The upholstery was in tatters, and even my limited knowledge of engines told me that something was seriously wrong under the hood. As we drove on, the landscape transformed, with massive boulders rising up in surreal formations. It felt as though we had wandered into a prehistoric world, where giants once roamed. Lost in thought, I glanced at Colonel Race and murmured, ""There must have been giants once.""",1
"I noticed it as we ascended the staircase of the tall building in a serene Kensington Square. Mrs. Flemming welcomed me with a friendly demeanor. She appeared to be a sturdy, calm woman of the ""ideal wife and mother"" category. Showing me to a pristine bedroom adorned with chintz, she assured me that tea would be served shortly and then departed, leaving me alone. Her voice, slightly elevated, drifted from the drawing-room below on the first level. ""Well, Henry, what in the world"" I couldn't make out the rest, but the sharpness of the tone was unmistakable.",1
"""And once they finally comprehend each other, the love has already vanished."" ""Is it the same in reverse? Are those who constantly bicker truly in love?"" ""I'm not sure,"" I replied, feeling a bit disoriented. He shifted his focus to the fireplace. ""Care for more soup?"" he asked nonchalantly. ""Yes, please. I'm famished enough to devour a hippopotamus."" ""Excellent."" He tended to the fire while I observed. ""Once I can pry myself off this couch, I'll whip up a meal for you,"" I vowed. ""I doubt you know the first thing about cooking."" ""I can heat up canned goods just as well as you can,"" I shot back, gesturing towards a line of cans on the mantelpiece. ""Touché,"" he chuckled.",1
"""I am Sir Eustace Pedler’s secretary,” I declared with authority. “Take me to his private car immediately.” Suzanne and Colonel Race were surprised to see me on the observation platform. “Well, well, Miss Anne,” exclaimed Colonel Race. “Back from Durban, are you? What a pleasant surprise.” Suzanne remained silent, her eyes full of unspoken questions. “I must find my chief,” I stated calmly. “Where is he?” “He’s in the office compartment,” Colonel Race replied. “Dictating at a remarkable pace to Miss Pettigrew.” “Such dedication to work,” I remarked. “Indeed,” agreed Colonel Race.",1
"""The inspector was amused by the overly polite demeanor. Célestine left in tears, escorted by the woman and the plain-clothes official. Without much explanation to Mrs. Opalsen, the inspector began searching the room. Drawers were pulled out, cupboards opened, the bed was left in disarray, and even the floor was tapped. Mr. Opalsen watched skeptically. “Do you truly believe you will uncover them?” “Absolutely. It's logical. She wouldn't have had the opportunity to remove them from the room.""",1
"Sir James scrutinized Tommy closely. ""Did they have any idea of what you knew while you were in that house? Taking Miss Tuppence was a strategic move after you escaped. They may resort to threats against her to keep you silent,"" he explained. Tommy nodded in agreement. ""That was my thinking as well, sir."" Sir James raised an eyebrow. ""You deduced that, did you? Impressive. Interestingly, they were unaware of your identity when they initially captured you. Are you positive that you didn't reveal who you were?"" Tommy shook his head firmly. ""I can assure you I did not,"" confirmed Julius with a knowing look. ""Someone must have tipped them off, but not until Sunday afternoon.""",1
"""I've been helping out a woman in the village,"" she disclosed, ""and since Lawrence mentioned you were with Mr. Poirot, I decided to come find you."" ""Oh, madame,"" Poirot replied, ""I was hoping you had come to pay me a visit!"" ""I will, someday, if you invite me,"" she replied with a smile. ""Very well. If you ever need someone to confide in, madame,"" he began, causing her to flinch, ""just remember, Papa Poirot is here for you."" She gazed at him intently, trying to decipher a hidden message in his words. Then, she turned away suddenly.",1
"Sir James checked his watch. “The boat train to Holyhead departs from Chester at 12.14. If you leave now, you might just make it in time.” Tommy, looking confused, questioned, “Is there a rush, sir? It's only the 24th today.” “It’s always good to start the day early,” Julius interjected before Sir James could respond. “Let’s head to the station immediately.” Sir James's brow creased slightly. “I wish I could accompany you, but I have a meeting at two o’clock. Unfortunate, really,” his reluctance apparent in his voice.",1
"""Art?” “Why, yes. What’s the difficulty? Rent a liner ” “A liner!” murmured Dr. Hall faintly. “Rent some passengers, rent a submarine that’s the only difficulty, I guess. Governments are apt to be a bit hide-bound over their engines of war. They won’t sell to the first-comer. Still, I guess that can be got over. Ever heard of the word ‘graft,’ sir? Well, graft gets there every time! I reckon that we shan’t really need to launch a torpedo. If every one hustles round and screams loud enough that the ship is sinking, it ought to be enough for an innocent young girl like Jane.",1
"""She appeared visibly distressed, her lack of appetite a clear sign of her emotional state."" ""Indeed,"" Poirot mused, ""it is quite understandable."" Retrieving a small briefcase from a drawer, he then addressed me. ""I am prepared. Let us make our way to the mansion to investigate further. Pardon me, my friend, but your attire is slightly disheveled. Allow me."" With a quick movement, he straightened my tie. ""There we go! Are you ready to proceed?"" We hastened towards the village, entering through the gates of the estate. Pausing briefly, Poirot gazed sadly across the expansive park, still shimmering in the morning light.",1
"""Let's go back to the hotel for lunch,"" Poirot suggested, looking at his watch. As we walked, Poirot suddenly stopped to measure an overcoat. Confused, I asked why, but Poirot simply replied, ""To see how long it is."" His mysterious behavior irritated me, but I couldn't shake the feeling that Mrs. Renauld was hiding something. Poirot agreed, revealing his suspicions about her involvement in the crime. He explained that the crime actually took place two hours earlier than believed, based on the condition of the body. Mrs. Renauld had lied about the time, and someone had tampered with the wrist watch to create a false alibi.",1
"""Rest assured, peace of mind will not come easily,” “Very well, I concur! You mention my disrespectful demeanor towards you. Well, on a few occasions, your behavior has irked me.” “I am pleased to hear it,” Poirot responded. “Good day, M. Giraud. Let's go, Hastings.” Walking in silence, my heart weighed heavily. Poirot had made his intentions glaringly clear. Doubts grew about my ability to rescue Bella from the aftermath of her actions. The unexpected encounter with Giraud had provoked Poirot and heightened his determination. Suddenly, a hand rested on my shoulder, and I turned to find Gabriel Stonor. We exchanged greetings and he suggested a leisurely walk back to our hotel.",1
"” I tried to follow his instructions, reviewing every aspect of the investigation. After careful consideration, it became apparent to me that Giraud's theory, which Poirot dismissed, was the most logical explanation. Contemplating further, I realized that the key to the puzzle likely lay with Madame Daubreuil. Giraud was unaware of her involvement in the Beroldy Case, a detail Poirot emphasized as crucial. Focused on this new lead, I felt a surge of hope. Then, a sudden burst of inspiration struck me, causing me to tremble as I pieced together a new theory.""",1
"""After a brief chat with the Inspector, the trio headed to the White Hart where they chatted about eggs and bacon along with Devonshire cider. ""Any updates?"" inquired Ingles, his lips curling into a grin. ""Indeed, the situation is crystal clear now; however, I anticipate significant challenges in substantiating it. Whalley's demise was orchestrated by the Big Four, but not at the hands of Grant. A cunning individual secured Grant the position and orchestrated a plan to frame him as the culprit, exploiting Grant's criminal history. He provided Grant with a pair of boots, one from a set of identical duplicates. The counterpart remained in his possession. The scheme was deceptively straightforward.""",1
"""Miss Halliday was with you for five months, correct?"" ""Indeed, sir. Your words are quite astonishing."" ""Nevertheless, they are true. Were these documents easily accessible? Or do you suspect someone with inside knowledge?"" ""It is rather strange that the burglars knew exactly where to search. Do you believe Inez "" ""Yes, I am certain that they were tipped off by her. But what was the valuable item that eluded the thieves? Precious gems?"" Madame Olivier shook her head slightly, smiling. ""Something far more valuable, sir."" She glanced around cautiously, then leaned in, lowering her voice. ""Radium, sir."" ""Radium?"" ""Indeed, sir.""",1
"""Mrs. Blair complimented, tilting her head. ""Share your story, Gipsy girl. What's your reason for heading to South Africa?"" I mentioned Papa's mission. ""So you're Charles Beddingfeld's daughter? You're not just an ordinary Miss, are you? Off to Broken Hill to dig up more skeletons?"" ""Possibly,"" I replied carefully. ""I have other plans too."" ""You're quite the enigmatic one. But you seem exhausted this morning. Did you not rest well? I can never stay awake on a ship. They say ten hours of sleep is for fools! I could use twenty!"" She yawned, resembling a drowsy kitten.",1
"""Mademoiselle, would you mind showing me once more the actions you described earlier? You were here working, correct?"" Célestine sat, stood up, went to the next room, picked up an item from the dresser, and came back. Poirot watched her closely, also keeping an eye on his bulky pocket watch. ""Could you do it one more time, please?"" After the repeat performance, he jotted something down in his notebook and put the watch away. ""Thank you, mademoiselle. And to you, sir,"" he nodded at the inspector, ""for your cooperation.""",1
"""Hastings,"" she asked abruptly, ""do you believe that my husband and I are content in our marriage?"" I hesitated, caught off guard by the question, and replied that it was not my place to speculate on such matters. ""Regardless,"" she continued calmly, ""I must confess that we are far from happy."" Sensing there was more to her story, I remained silent as she paced the room with a graceful, contemplative demeanor. Pausing in front of me, she locked eyes and posed the question, ""Do you truly understand who I am?""",1
"As we anxiously awaited the results, Poirot took it upon himself to verify the nurse's credentials. ""I must proceed with caution, my friend,"" he warned, citing the threat of the Big Four. After confirming that Nurse Mabel Palmer was indeed from the Lark Institute, Poirot seemed satisfied. Soon enough, Nurse Palmer returned with the analyst's report in hand. We watched intently as Poirot scanned the report, the nurse unable to contain her nerves. ""Does it contain arsenic?"" she inquired, her voice filled with apprehension.",1
"""This is Achille Poirot,"" I announced firmly. ""Hercule Poirot's identical twin."" Ryland scoffed, his doubt evident. ""Hercule's scheme has triumphed splendidly,"" Achille stated calmly. Number Four lunged menacingly. ""Triumphed, you say?"" he growled. ""Do you understand that your time is running out?"" ""Yes,"" acknowledged Achille solemnly. ""I am aware. It is you who fail to comprehend that some are willing to sacrifice their lives for success. Just as soldiers did in the war. I am ready to do the same for the greater good.""",1
"""It announced the suicide of Li Chang Yen, the mastermind behind the recent failed revolution. Poirot reflected solemnly, ""He was my formidable adversary, yet our paths never crossed. Upon learning of the defeat, he chose to end his own life. A brilliant mind, indeed. Though I do wonder about the identity of Number Four... Perhaps it is merely wishful thinking. He is gone. Together, we have triumphed over the Big Four; now you can reunite with your beloved spouse, while I must bid farewell. The most significant case of my career has concluded.""",1
"""And I know it for certain, as he borrowed two skeins of my black wool for the very purpose! It seemed incredibly lifelike from afar, I must say. I hadn't even realized there was a beard up there. It seems to be a recent addition, in my opinion. The only other thing was a red wig. They usually use burnt corks, though it's quite a hassle to remove. Miss Cynthia had once disguised herself as a black person, and the struggles she faced were immense."" ""So, Dorcas is completely unaware of the black beard,"" Poirot remarked thoughtfully as we exited into the hallway once more. ""Do you believe it's the same one?"" I asked eagerly. Poirot confirmed. ""Yes, I do. Did you notice that it had been neatly groomed?"" ""No.""",1
"""The Prime Minister must be there, if humanly possible. Let's hope it's not too late. Gentlemen, start from the beginning. I need all the details on this shooting incident."" ""Yesterday evening, the Prime Minister and his secretary, Captain Daniels"" ""The same one who went with him to France?"" ""Yes. As I was saying, they drove to Windsor, where the Prime Minister had a meeting. This morning, he came back to the city, and that's when the assassination attempt happened."" ""Hold on a moment. Who exactly is Captain Daniels? Do you have his background information?"" Lord Estair smirked.",1
"'In addition to the symbol of two crossed lines through an S, which signifies a dollar, Number Two is also denoted by two stripes and a star. This suggests his American nationality and association with wealth. Consider this along with Ryland's substantial bribe to lure me away from England. What are your thoughts, Hastings?"" ""Are you implying,"" I asked, taken aback, ""that Abe Ryland, the wealthy magnate, could be Number Two of the notorious Big Four?"" ""You've caught on quickly, Hastings. Indeed, that is my suspicion.""",1
"""Well, it seems like they plan to create their own version of Jane Finn at a boarding school in Paris,"" Tuppence exclaimed in shock. Mr. Carter just smiled. ""No one knows what she actually looks like, so we are safe on that front. She will pretend to have a made-up story, but her real objective is to gather information from us. Do you understand?"" Tuppence paused to fully grasp the situation. ""So, you believe that they wanted me to go to Paris posing as Jane Finn?"" Mr. Carter, with a wearier smile, replied, ""I do believe in coincidences."" Tuppence, regaining her composure, remarked, ""It does seem like fate has a hand in this."" Carter nodded in agreement. ""I understand exactly what you mean.""",1
"""Shall we start?"" asked Poirot. ""Yes,"" Black replied nervously. Poirot took out his watch and placed it on the table. ""Let's begin. Day."" ""Night,"" Black responded. Poirot continued, ""Name."" ""Place."" ""Bernard."" ""Shaw."" ""Tuesday."" ""Dinner."" ""Journey."" ""Ship."" ""Country."" ""Uganda."" ""Story."" ""Lions."" ""Rook Rifle."" ""Farm."" ""Shot."" ""Suicide."" ""Elephant."" ""Tusks."" ""Money."" ""Lawyers."" Poirot explained his analysis to Hastings. He then spoke to Black, who confirmed a story about a suicide with a rook rifle on a farm. Poirot later broke the news to the widow, who was in denial. After dinner, a scream was heard, causing fear in the household. The door inexplicably opened, adding to the eerie atmosphere.",1
"At the stroke of one o’clock, I was certain that something would occur. Throughout the night, I could hear my fellow passengers retiring to their cabins. Bits of conversation and laughter drifted in through the transom before all fell silent. The majority of the lights extinguished, leaving only a faint glow from the lone light in the corridor. As the sound of eight bells resonated through the ship, the ensuing hour felt interminable. I discreetly checked my watch, anxious not to miss the anticipated event.",1
"""I object, that’s a dirty move,” I exclaimed. “Absolutely necessary. We’re up against a cunning and ruthless opponent, and we must employ all available tactics or else he will escape us. That’s why I’ve made sure to stay in the shadows. Japp has made all the breakthroughs, and Japp will receive all the glory. If I do end up testifying” he grinned widely “it will likely be in support of the defense.” I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. “It’s all above board,” Poirot explained. “Interestingly, I possess evidence that contradicts one of the prosecution’s arguments.” “Which one?” “The one regarding the will’s destruction.""",1
"""Perhaps in the future, I could facilitate a marriage suitable for you."" ""I appreciate the offer,"" I chuckled, ""but marriage is not on my mind."" Poirot let out a sigh and shook his head. ""The English!"" he muttered. ""They rely too much on chance."" He furrowed his brow and adjusted the salt shaker. ""You mentioned Mademoiselle Cinderella is staying at Hôtel d’Angleterre, correct?"" ""No, she's at Hôtel du Phare."" ""Ah, I stand corrected."" A brief moment of doubt crossed my thoughts. Had I disclosed the hotel information to Poirot before?",1
"Brown provided summaries of reports from different unions, with the miners' report being the most satisfactory. The railways needed to be held back, and there were concerns about trouble with the A.S.E. After a period of silence, Tommy heard fingers drumming on the table. Number One inquired about the date, which was revealed to be the 29th. The Russian expressed that it was rather soon, but it had been settled by the principal Labour leaders and interference needed to be minimal. They must believe it was entirely their own show.",1
"“I always have a gun with me. Little Willie is my trusty companion,” he said, showing a menacing weapon before carefully putting it away. “But we won't need him this time. No one will warn Mr. Brown.” The lawyer simply shrugged. “Just like no one warned Mr. Brown about Mrs. Vandemeyer's betrayal. Yet, she took her secrets to the grave.” Julius fell silent, and Sir James concluded with a hint of humor: “Just a friendly warning. Farewell, and stay safe. Don't take any unnecessary chances once you have the documents. If you suspect you're being followed, get rid of them immediately.”",1
"""Perhaps he wouldn't have believed it,"" I thought to myself. I decided to come clean in the spur of the moment. ""You know, doctor,"" I began, ""I feel like a complete idiot. But I have to tell you, my intentions were not related to the Bill Sikes incident."" I then rambled on about a girl, bringing up the whole strict guardian act, a supposed nervous breakdown, and how I thought I saw her at the home, leading to my nightly escapades. It seemed like the kind of tale he was anticipating. ""What a story,"" he remarked cheerfully once I had finished.",1
"""And stated in that manner,"" she whispered to Tommy, ""no one could object to the cost!"" No one did, and that was the important part. ""And now,"" the young woman declared the day after they moved in, ""let's get to work!"" Mr. Beresford set aside the Daily Mail he had been perusing and clapped with somewhat excessive enthusiasm. His companion politely told him not to be foolish. ""Come on, Tommy, we need to earn our keep."" Tommy let out a sigh. ""Indeed, even the generous Government won't fund our luxury lifestyle at the Ritz indefinitely."" ""So, as I mentioned earlier, we must take action.""",1
"Poirot and I arrived at Marsdon Manor to investigate the death of Mr. Maltravers, who had recently insured his life for a large sum of money. The circumstances surrounding his death were suspicious, as he was found with signs of internal hemorrhage and financial troubles. Dr. Bernard, the local doctor, provided us with some information but seemed vague and unhelpful. Mrs. Maltravers, the widow, was distraught and beautiful, and Poirot handled the delicate situation with his usual tact and charm. Our investigation led to more questions than answers, and as we were leaving, a tall young man approached us.",1
"“Hey, Bex!” he shouted. “Come take a look at this. There’s plenty of clues here for you.” The commissary approached and grinned. “Poirot, my friend, those footprints clearly belong to the gardener’s big hobnailed boots. And besides, it doesn’t matter much since there are no trees on this side, hence no way to access the upper floor.” “Fair point,” Poirot replied, looking disappointed. “So you believe these footprints are insignificant?” “Absolutely not.” To my surprise, Poirot then uttered: “I beg to differ with you.",1
"She couldn't possibly be involved, or else I would have caught wind of it by now. Dr. Bauerstein's arrest couldn't stay hidden forever, especially with the news spreading in the papers tomorrow. But I hesitated to break the news to her. If only Poirot was around for advice. Why did he have to rush off to London like that? Despite my reservations, I couldn't help but admire his insight. I never would have considered the doctor a suspect if Poirot hadn't planted the idea. Yes, without a doubt, the little man was cunning.",1
"""Absolutely shocking, Cavendish!"" exclaimed Miss Howard, her expression grim. ""I fear I may have said some rather unforgettable things to Emily. Perhaps they will eventually sink in. But who knows, it might just be water off a duck's back. I did not hold back: 'You're an old woman, Emily, and there's no fool like an old fool. The man is twenty years your junior, and let's not kid ourselves about why he married you. Money! Be cautious with your finances. Farmer Raikes, on the other hand, has a lovely young wife. Just inquire with Alfred about how often he visits there.' Needless to say, she was furious.""",1
"Poirot felt sympathy for the unfortunate lady, but his loyalty lay with the Insurance Company. As he prepared to depart, he whispered to Mrs. Maltravers: “Madame, you must understand, there are no true endings.” “What are you implying?” she asked, her gaze filled with fear. “Have you ever delved into the world of spiritualism? You possess a unique gift.” “I have been told as much. But surely you do not believe in such things?” “Madame, I have witnessed the inexplicable. Rumor has it that this house is plagued by spirits.” She nodded in agreement, just as the parlourmaid appeared to announce that dinner was served.",1
"""Now, whether it was Lawrence or John, Mary Cavendish's behavior remained just as perplexing. But if it was indeed John, everything suddenly made perfect sense."" ""Ah!"" I exclaimed, a sudden realization dawning on me, ""it was John who had a disagreement with his mother that day?"" ""Precisely."" ""And you've been aware of this from the start?"" ""Of course. Mrs. Cavendish's actions pointed in only one direction."" ""Yet you still believe he might be found innocent?"" Poirot simply shrugged in response. ""Indeed, I do.""",1
"""But had Miss Tuppence not altered her plans, she would have been long gone from the flat by the time we got there. The threat of exposure loomed over him. In a bold move, he relied on his assumed identity to deflect any doubts. He came close to success, but it was not enough.” “It's hard to fathom,” Jane whispered. “He appeared so impressive.” “The real Julius Hersheimmer was truly remarkable! And Mr. Brown is a masterful performer. But ask Miss Tuppence if she, too, harbored suspicions.” Jane looked wordlessly at Tuppence. The latter confirmed. “I hesitated to mention it, Jane, I was afraid it would upset you. Besides, I couldn't be certain.""",1
"I grinned to myself as I looked around. The ocean appeared calm, providing a sense of tranquility. After a satisfactory dinner, I observed my fellow travelers and engaged in a couple of rounds of Bridge. Eventually, I retired for the night and fell into a deep slumber, a common occurrence for me at sea. Abruptly, I was roused from my sleep by a persistent shaking. Struggling to comprehend my surroundings, I was met by the concerned gaze of a ship's officer looming over me. With a sigh of relief, he expressed his struggle to awaken me. ""Do you always sleep so soundly?"" he inquired. Still disoriented from sleep, I questioned, ""What's going on?""",1
"""But the body is frail, it is reassuring to know that one is headed in the right direction. Oh, my companion, I feel as if I have been rejuvenated. I sprint! I soar!"" And indeed, he sprinted and leaped, frolicking wildly across the expanse of grass outside the expansive window. ""What is your peculiar little acquaintance up to?"" came a voice from behind me, and I turned to see Mary Cavendish beside me. She grinned, and so did I. ""What is going on?"" ""Honestly, I have no idea. He posed some question to Dorcas about a bell, and was so pleased with her response that he is now frolicking about like you see!"" Mary chuckled.",1
"""Fooled them all this time, huh?"" The girl glanced at him, nodded, and then suddenly broke down in tears. Julius comforted her. ""There, just stay calm. We won't let you give up."" Amidst her crying, the girl mumbled, ""You sound like home. Your voice makes me miss home."" ""Yes, I'm from home. Your cousin Julius Hersheimmer. I came to Europe specifically to find you, and what a wild goose chase it's been."" The car slowed down. George called out, ""Intersection up ahead, sir. Not entirely sure of the way.""",1
"He recited the formula to the elderly woman, who seemed more like a housekeeper than a servant, that greeted him at the door. “Christian name?” “Margaret.” Tommy spelled it out, but was corrected. “No, g u e.” “Oh, Marguerite; the French way, I see.” After a brief pause, he asked, “We had her down as Rita Vandemeyer, but I suppose that’s incorrect?” “She’s mostly called that, sir, but Marguerite’s her name.” “Thank you. That’s all. Good morning.” Tommy rushed down the stairs, barely able to contain his excitement. Tuppence was waiting at the turn. “You heard?” “Yes. Oh, Tommy!” Tommy offered a sympathetic squeeze of her arm. “I know, old thing.""",1
"“Can I interest you in something unique? Exotic furs, rare curios?” “I'm looking for something truly extraordinary,” I replied. “It's for a special event. Can you show me what you have?” “Would you care to step into my private showroom? We house a variety of exclusive items there.” That's where I made a critical error. I thought I was being so clever. I followed him past the beaded curtains. (Anne’s Story Continues) Dealing with Suzanne was a challenge. She argued, she begged, she even cried before reluctantly agreeing to go along with my scheme. Eventually, I convinced her to follow my instructions precisely, and she came to the train station to bid me a tearful goodbye.",1
"“Do you see the problem here? How could he have accessed the cocoa? It wasn't downstairs,” I reluctantly conceded. A dreadful possibility suddenly crossed my mind, one that I hoped John wouldn't consider. Glancing at him, I saw a perplexed frown on his face, which brought me a sense of relief. The terrifying thought that had entered my mind was the idea that Dr. Bauerstein might have had help. But surely that couldn't be true! A woman as stunning as Mary Cavendish couldn't possibly be involved in murder. However, history has shown that even beautiful women have resorted to poison.",1
"“You slept well, correct? Have you recovered from the dreadful crossing? You appear almost normal this morning. Excuse me, but your tie is askew. Allow me to fix it for you.” I have previously introduced Hercule Poirot. A remarkable individual! Standing at five feet four inches tall, with an egg-shaped head tilted slightly to one side, eyes that gleamed green in excitement, a stiff military moustache, and a profound air of dignity! He was always impeccably dressed. Neatness was his absolute obsession. Any hint of disorder or dirt was unbearable to him until he could rectify the situation.",1
"“What in the world does this signify?” I inquired, taken aback. It had been quite pleasant to receive a kiss from Cynthia, but the public nature of the gesture somewhat dampened the enjoyment. “It signifies that she has realized Monsieur Lawrence does not despise her as much as she believed,” Poirot responded philosophically. “But ” “Here he comes.” Lawrence walked by the door at that moment. “Ah! Monsieur Lawrence,” Poirot called out. “We must offer our congratulations, should we not?” Lawrence blushed, then smiled awkwardly. A man in love is a pitiable sight. Just a moment ago, Cynthia had looked delightful. I let out a sigh. “What is the matter, my friend?” “Nothing,” I replied dejectedly.",1
"""What was his next move after leaving the scene, after the alleged murder or, as you claim, discovering the body. Where did he disappear to?” I maintained my silence. “I can't help but wonder,” Suzanne pondered. “Could he have convinced Sir Eustace Pedler to take him on as his secretary? It would provide a rare opportunity to escape England without raising suspicion. But how did he persuade Sir Eustace? It appears he had some leverage over him.” “Perhaps over Pagett as well,” I interjected involuntarily. “You don’t seem to trust Pagett, Anne. Sir Eustace praises him as a diligent and competent young man.""",1
"I noticed that the cupboard appeared empty at first, but my persistence paid off when I discovered a hard paper cylinder hidden in a trough in the corner. Upon grabbing it, I immediately recognized it as a roll of Kodak films. This was a valuable discovery! While I considered the possibility that the films belonged to Sir Eustace Pedler and had been overlooked during the cupboard's previous search, the red paper seemed too new for that to be the case.",1
"Hurriedly following his precise instructions, I found myself alone in my sleeping quarters, my belongings neatly stowed away. With the clock ticking towards departure, Paggett had failed to anticipate Suzanne's intervention. ""Prepare for a scorching journey ahead,"" she warned. ""Do you have any eau-de-Cologne or lavender water handy?"" My response was immediate. ""Oh no, I must have left it behind at the hotel,"" I lamented, playing my part in Suzanne's orchestration of events.",1
"I never considered myself to be particularly attractive. My features were far from the ideal standards of beauty - no straight Grecian nose or rosebud mouth for me. The only compliment I ever received was from a curate who compared my eyes to ""imprisoned sunshine in a dark, dark wood"", but I always suspected he had a quote ready for every occasion. Personally, I would have preferred Irish blue eyes over my dark green ones with yellow flecks. However, green does have a certain allure for women of intrigue. Wrapping myself in a black garment, I left my arms and shoulders exposed. Tucking my hair behind my ears, I applied a generous amount of powder to my face, giving my skin an unnaturally pale complexion.",1
"""I am conducting an investigation into the passing of Mr. Renauld. Surely, you are aware of it?"" She nodded silently, her face remaining impassive. ""We have come to inquire if you might shed some light on the events surrounding it?"" ""Me?"" Her tone conveyed genuine surprise. ""Indeed, madam. It would be preferable if we could converse in private."" He gestured discreetly towards the young woman. Madame Daubreuil glanced at her. ""Marthe, my dear."" But the young woman refused. ""No, mother, I will stay. I am not a child. I am twenty-two. I have no intention of leaving."" Madame Daubreuil then redirected her attention to the investigator.",1
"Tommy immediately identified him as an Irish Sinn Feiner. Mr. Brown’s operation clearly had a wide reach. From the ordinary criminal to the refined Irishman, the mysterious Russian, and the precise German orchestrator! Such an odd and menacing group! Who was this figure who controlled these diverse pieces of an unfamiliar puzzle? The process played out in the usual manner. The prearranged knock, the request for a code, and the confirmation “Right.” Two more knocks quickly sounded on the door downstairs. The initial individual remained a stranger to Tommy, whom he assumed to be a clerk from the city.",1
"Nadina, a renowned Russian dancer, gracefully accepted the accolades of her adoring audience in Paris. As the curtain fell, she was greeted by the Manager, who praised her exceptional performance. Nadina, accustomed to praise and admiration, made her way to the dressing-room where Jeanne, her loyal dresser, awaited her. Amidst the bouquets and luxurious garments, a visitor arrived - Count Sergius Paulovitch. Switching to English, they engaged in a cryptic conversation about the enigmatic 'Colonel' and his impending retirement. Nadina hinted at a mysterious plan involving a trip to London, leaving the Count intrigued and curious. As they exchanged knowing glances, the future seemed uncertain and filled with intrigue.",1
"""We've been at this for half a year,"" I pondered aloud. ""And where has it gotten us, Poirot? I can't shake the feeling that we need to take action."" ""Always full of energy, Hastings! But what exactly do you propose?"" It was a challenging question, but I stood my ground. ""It's time to go on the offensive,"" I insisted. ""What do we have to show for all this time?"" ""More than you realize, mon ami. We've uncovered the identities of Number Two and Number Three, and we've gained insight into the tactics of Number Four."" Hearing this, I felt a glimmer of hope.",1
"The guide led me through a labyrinth of narrow alleys, eventually halting in front of a rundown building. He knocked four times on the door, and it swung open to reveal another Chinaman. Without a word, he stepped aside, allowing us to enter. As the door closed behind me, I realized I was trapped, surrounded by adversaries. The second Chinaman took charge of me, guiding me down creaking stairs into a musty cellar filled with crates and barrels, emanating the scent of exotic spices.",1
"""Enthralled by the tale proposed by Madame Daubreuil, she willingly allows herself to be silenced and tied up. Well, Poirot, what's your take on this?"" I reclined, beaming with the satisfaction of a successful reconstruction. Poirot gazed at me pensively. ""You should consider writing for the cinema, my friend,"" he finally commented. ""You think?"" ""It would translate well onto screen, the narrative you've just shared with me, but it lacks realism."" ""I confess I haven't delved into all the specifics, yet..."" ""You've gone beyond that - you've skillfully disregarded them.""",1
"I couldn't help but notice that you were three minutes late, despite saying it would only be two. Your scientific background must be to blame for that, as women are usually quite punctual. Despite finding Lord Nasby tiresome, I left feeling triumphant. My plan had worked better than expected - Lord Nasby was surprisingly friendly. Now, all that was left was to prove myself. Once alone in my room, I carefully examined my valuable piece of paper.",1
"""I completely agree. So, we should seek out the origins of the note,"" said the commissary. ""I will immediately send a message to the authorities in Santiago, asking for all information regarding the victim's life there - his romantic relationships, business dealings, friendships, and any enemies he might have had. It would be surprising if we don't uncover a lead to his perplexing murder after that."" The commissary looked around for confirmation. ""Wonderful,"" Poirot remarked approvingly. ""His spouse might also provide us with some insight,"" the magistrate suggested. ""Have you discovered any additional correspondence from this Bella among M.""",1
"Nearby, a collection of suitcases sat neatly arranged by size - from large to small. The implication was clear. ""Are you leaving?"" ""Yes."" ""Where to?"" ""South America."" ""What?"" ""Indeed, a comedy of errors, is it not? I am bound for Rio, and every day I tell myself, I will reveal nothing in my letters - oh! the shock on good Hastings' face when he sees me!"" ""When do you depart?"" Poirot glanced at his watch. ""In one hour."" ""But I thought you always swore off long sea voyages?"" Poirot shut his eyes, a shiver passing through him. ""Let us not speak of it, my friend.",1
"""Suppress your strikingly beautiful and sincere nature and take a seat. Let me tell you, sir, what is there to stop me from calling the authorities and handing you over to them, while my companion here prevents you from fleeing?"" ""Feel free to do so if you deem it necessary,"" responded our guest in a composed manner. ""Oh, come on, Poirot,"" I exclaimed. ""I can't take this anymore. Call the police and get it over with."" Moving quickly, I walked to the door and positioned myself with my back against it. ""It appears to be the most logical course of action,"" Poirot muttered, as if contemplating. ""But you are wary of the obvious, aren't you?"" remarked our visitor, with a smile. ""Proceed, Poirot,"" I encouraged.",1
"Tuppence found a discreet location. A disheveled maid, sporting a notably grimy face and mismatched eyes, opened the door. Tommy brandished a notebook and pencil. “Greetings,” he exclaimed energetically. “Representing the Hampstead Borough Council. The updated Voting Register. Mrs. Edgar Keith resides in this establishment, correct?” “Indeed,” replied the maid. “First name?” inquired Tommy, pencil at the ready. “The missus? Eleanor Jane.” “Eleanor,” Tommy wrote. “Any adult children?” “None.” “Much obliged.” Tommy shut the notebook smartly. “Good day.”",1
"I turned to Poirot, who was already on the phone. ""It's your responsibility now, my friend,"" he said. Just then, the man lunged towards me with the agility of a cat. But I was prepared. We grappled with each other, circling around the room. Suddenly, he stumbled and I took the opportunity to take him down. However, my triumph was short-lived as I was thrown against the wall, landing in a tangled mess. I quickly recovered, only to find the door shutting in front of me, trapping me inside. Frantically, I grabbed the phone from Poirot. ""Call the bureau! Stop that man from leaving!""",1
"It was clear that out of several hundred applicants for No. 4, Montagu Mansions only the Robinsons were considered suitable. Elsa Hardt and her partner, from New York, took the flat in the name of Mr. and Mrs. Robinson to escape the Mafia or the Camorra. They offered the flat at a low rental to attract a fair-haired Mrs. Robinson. The plan was to strike when the avenger arrived. Poirot deduced this scheme and saved them from being hanged. The house was watched, and the police were on their way. Our beautiful lady will not escape.",1
"""Ah, that must be Japp and his crew pulling up."" A loud thud echoed on the door. ""How could you have found this location?"" I inquired as I trailed Poirot into the hallway. ""Ah, yes, you tailed the first Mrs. Robinson after she departed the other apartment."" ""Well done, Hastings. Your brain cells are finally in action. Now, time for a surprise for Japp."" Quietly unlocking the door, he peeked the cat's head around the corner and let out a sharp ""Meow."" The inspector from Scotland Yard, accompanied by another man, flinched involuntarily. ""Ah, it's just Monsieur Poirot up to his usual tricks!"" he exclaimed, while Poirot's head emerged next to the cat's.",1
"Opening the drawer revealed a photograph that sparked suspicion. Recalling the tale of Inspector Brown obtaining it, Julius came to mind as a potential suspect. However, the discovery of the false Jane Finn by Sir James added another layer of intrigue. Unable to reach a conclusion, I opted for caution. Leaving a note for Julius, in case he was Mr. Brown, I fabricated a trip to the Argentine. Placing Sir James's job offer letter conspicuously on the desk, I ensured its authenticity. Finally, I penned a letter to Mr. Carter and phoned Sir James.",1
"""Alright."" He pressed the bell. Dorcas arrived promptly. ""Dorcas, ask Manning to come see me here."" ""Of course, sir."" Dorcas left. A tense silence enveloped us. Poirot, unfazed, casually dusted a neglected corner of the bookcase. The sound of heavy boots on the gravel signaled Manning's arrival. John glanced at Poirot, who nodded in response. ""Step in, Manning,"" John instructed, ""I need to have a word with you."" Manning entered cautiously through the French window, positioning himself close to it.",1
"""And the cup on the mantelpiece, half drunk, that would be Mr. Lawrence Cavendish’s. And the one on the tray?” “John Cavendish’s. I saw him put it down there.” “Good. One, two, three, four, five but where, then, is the cup of Mr. Inglethorp?” “He does not take coffee.” “Then all are accounted for. One moment, my friend.” With meticulous attention, he extracted a drop or two from the grounds in each cup, preserving them in individual vials, sampling each in succession. His countenance underwent a peculiar transformation.""",1
"The French window creaked open further, revealing an elegant elderly woman with white hair and a commanding presence. She gracefully emerged onto the lawn, followed by a man who displayed a hint of subservience in his demeanor. Mrs. Inglethorp warmly welcomed me back, expressing her delight at our reunion. Introducing me to her husband, Alfred, she looked on with anticipation. Taking note of Alfred's unusual appearance, I couldn't help but be intrigued. His lengthy, pitch-black beard was undeniably striking, providing a stark contrast to his surroundings.",1
"Poirot and I hurried to Saint-Omer to meet M. Hautet, the examining magistrate. We were ushered into his room, where he expressed his relief that Poirot had not actually returned to England. M. Hautet lamented the skill of Giraud, the detective, and his certainty of Jack Renauld's guilt. Poirot, however, remained unconvinced, citing various obscure points in the case. When asked about Jack's defense, M. Hautet revealed his frustration with Jack's silence during questioning. The magistrate also shared concerns about Madame Renauld's fragile mental state after the tragic events. As the conversation turned to a letter for Poirot, I couldn't shake the feeling of impending doom.",1
"""I see it as the most effective approach."" ""Appreciate it, Sir Eustace."" ""Could it be her spouse? Husbands can be quite bothersome. They always appear at the most inconvenient times."" ""I am confused, Sir Eustace. Whose spouse are you referring to?"" ""The woman's spouse."" ""Which woman?"" ""Heavens, Pagett, the woman from your encounter in Florence. Surely there was a woman involved. You can't tell me you only burglarized a church or attacked an Italian because you didn't like his appearance."" ""I am completely bewildered, Sir Eustace. I assume you are jesting.""",1
"Hurry, we need to go before they return."" Grabbing his hand, she quickly and quietly pulled him out of the room. I followed closely behind. She guided us through the outer room and into the tunnel we originally came through, but soon after took a different turn. Despite the numerous forks in the passage, she never hesitated, leading us with confidence and increasing speed. ""We have to make it in time,"" she gasped. ""We must reach the open before the explosion."" We continued on, the tunnel cutting straight through the mountain, eventually leading us to the other side and a new valley. Sweat dripped down my face, but I pressed forward.",1
"""It's unusual under certain circumstances, none of which, however, seem to have been present in this instance. I assume Mrs. Inglethorp consumed the coffee post-dinner around eight o’clock, yet the symptoms didn't show up until the early morning hours, suggesting the drug was ingested much later in the evening."" ""Mrs. Inglethorp used to have a cup of cocoa in the middle of the night. Could the strychnine have been added to that?"" ""No, I personally tested the cocoa left in the saucepan and had it analyzed.""",1
"Annette softly turned the key and opened the door. Tommy's heart raced as he wondered if she had come to his rescue. Conrad's voice interrupted, declaring that Tommy did not want any supper that night. Tommy felt a wave of disappointment wash over him as he realized he was still utterly helpless in his current situation.",1
"""And what do you think happened?"" ""I am not ready to reveal my theory just yet. My investigation has only just begun,"" replied the detective. ""One question, M. Giraud,"" Poirot interjected. ""Your theory accounts for the door being opened, but why was it left ajar? Wouldn't it have been more logical to close it upon their departure? If a police officer happened to pass by to check on the premises, they could have been caught immediately."" ""They simply overlooked it. A careless error, I admit.""",1
"""You couldn't possibly understand the depth of my feelings,"" he spat, his eyes burning with anger. ""You may have proposed to her, but it was I who truly loved her. I would have sacrificed everything to protect her. I would have willingly watched from the sidelines as she walked down the aisle with you, knowing that you could provide the life she deserved, while I was nothing but a destitute fool. But don't you dare think for a second that I didn't care!"" Julius started to speak, but was abruptly cut off. ""Save your breath,"" he sneered. ""I have no interest in hearing about 'little Tuppence' from you. Go attend to your cousin and leave me be.""",1
"Renauld left his tattered coat and pants in the shed, avoiding bringing them inside the house. To support Madame Renauld's story, they cruelly stabbed him with an airplane dagger. That evening, Mr. Renauld tied up his wife and silenced her, then proceeded to dig a grave in the precise location where he planned to build a shelter. It was crucial for the corpse to be discovered without raising any doubts for Madame Daubreuil. Waiting a while would reduce the risk of being identified.",1
"As Ned greeted Harry and the dripping female, he provided them with food, hot coffee, and dry clothes. Meanwhile, he discreetly inquired about Sir Eustace's party at the hotel. Anne firmly refused to go to Beira, fearing for her safety now that her enemies knew she was alive. Instead, she planned to join Suzanne and wait for further instructions. The diamonds were to be stored in the Bank under the name of Parker. To avoid deception, any genuine messages from Harry would have the word 'and' crossed out, and wires signed 'Andy.' Despite the chaos, Anne jokingly asked Harry about marrying someone else, to which he threatened to wring the other man's neck. Anne teased Harry about his unpredictability, highlighting their playful banter.",1
"In a matter of minutes, he watched his two chasers, one of whom was German, diligently following the false trail! Taking a seat on the stoop, Tommy rested briefly to catch his breath. After a brief pause, he leisurely wandered in the opposite direction. Checking his watch, he noted the time was a little past half-past five, with daylight increasing rapidly. As he turned the corner, a wary policeman observed him. Tommy felt a twinge of annoyance, but then chuckled as he realized he hadn't shaved or washed in three days! Looking quite the sight, he promptly made his way to a 24-hour Turkish Bath he was familiar with, without further delay.",1
"""Not until tonight, when you’re going to burst upon everyone like King Solomon in his glory! Come on! We're going to shop!” To most people, the 29th, the much-heralded ""Labour Day,"" had passed much as any other day. Speeches were made in the Park and Trafalgar Square. Straggling processions, singing the Red Flag, wandered through the streets in a more or less aimless manner. Newspapers that had hinted at a general strike and the inauguration of a reign of terror were forced to hide their diminished heads. The bolder and more astute among them sought to prove that peace had been effected by following their counsels.",1
"I wonder what secrets Pagett is hiding. He always seems to know more than he lets on. But tonight, it's all about the Fancy Dress dance. Mrs. Blair and Race are both on the guest list. The Beddingfeld girl, with those perfect legs, will be joining us as well. Pagett, however, seems to have other plans. Instead, a man named Reeves will be accompanying us. He may be small, but he holds valuable information that I can't afford to miss. The evening promises to be eventful, filled with dancing and champagne. And as for Colonel Race, well, he seems to have some interesting stories to tell. Let's see if I can top them with a tale of my own.",1
"It was meticulous work, requiring careful planning and execution. The perpetrator had gone to great lengths to cover his tracks, disguising himself with a false beard and wig before carrying out the crime. The victim, Count Foscatini, had been found brutally murdered in his own flat, the murder weapon a marble statuette left lying nearby. The scene was eerily quiet, with the unfinished meal on the table suggesting that the crime had taken place during dinner. The doctor quickly confirmed that the victim had been killed instantly, leaving little chance for help to arrive in time.",1
"No sooner had Sir Eustace stepped outside than he reached for a speaking-tube resting nearby. ""Schwart, keep an eye on Minks. He is not allowed to leave the premises without my approval,"" he commanded before setting the tube back down. With a furrowed brow, he began tapping the table lightly with his hand. ""Sir Eustace, may I inquire about a few matters?"" I finally spoke up, breaking the silence that had settled between us. ""Of course. You truly possess remarkable composure, Anne. While others may be fretting and panicking, you exhibit a keen curiosity and presence of mind.""",1
"In contrast, I found myself silently pleased. I am not a complete idiot. ""Nevertheless,"" I stated seriously, ""I believe we will."" ""Why?"" I shook my head, unable to articulate the emotion behind my words. ""I never want to lay eyes on you again,"" he abruptly and forcefully declared. It was quite impolite, but I merely chuckled quietly and disappeared into the shadows. I heard him begin to follow me, then stop, and a single word drifted down the deck. I believe it was ""witch""! (Extract from the journal of Sir Eustace Pedler) At the Mount Nelson Hotel in Cape Town. It is truly a huge relief to disembark from the Kilmorden.",1
"I watched as horror overtook her expression, her once debonair demeanor now extinguished. She had ignored my advice, and now faced the consequences. I was uncharacteristically ruthless towards her. She needed to face the truth. Turning the body over gently, I pointed out, ""He was stabbed in the back."" Her response was barely audible. ""With what?"" I gestured towards the glass jar. ""That dagger."" Without warning, she staggered and collapsed. I rushed to her side. ""You're faint. Let's get you out of here. This has all been too much for you."" ""Water,"" she whispered.",1
"""I inquired about the circumstances. Both of us were daring and eager for danger. One evening, we exchanged identity tokens for good fortune! Lucas met his end the following day, torn apart in an explosion."" I recoiled in horror. ""But why keep it from me until now? Why not this morning? Surely, you must have known by now that I care for you deeply?"" ""Anne, I didn't want to ruin everything. I wanted to take you away to the island. What use is money? It cannot buy happiness. We could have found joy on the island. I'm telling you, I fear that other life, it almost destroyed me once."" ""Did Sir Eustace recognize your true identity?"" ""Of course, he did.""",1
"""I was just chatting with Miller, the investigator working on the Davenheim case,"" I overheard. The mysterious vanishing of Mr. Davenheim, a prominent figure in the banking world, had captured headlines for days. Eager to learn more, I engaged in conversation with Japp, hoping for some intriguing insights. ""In this day and age, disappearing seems nearly impossible,"" I mused. Poirot, adjusting a plate of bread and butter with precision, interjected sharply: ""Accuracy is key, my friend.""",1
"I am alone and desperate, begging for Jack's salvation. Marthe Daubreuil pleaded with me to help. We rushed to Villa Marguerite immediately, where Marthe awaited us, clinging to Poirot. She was tormented, unable to see Jack in prison. Poirot reassured her, suggesting Jack may be protecting someone. Marthe suspected Jack's mother, accusing her of foul play. Poirot questioned Marthe about her mother's true identity and revealed shocking truths about M. Renauld. Overwhelmed, Marthe begged Poirot to save the man she loved. The next morning, we witnessed Jack's deteriorating state during his examination.",1
"“Poirot was about to continue when the door burst open, revealing a magnificent figure. With his impeccably styled black hair and polished boots, Gregory Rolf entered the room exuding an air of heroism. ""I promised to stop by, Mary,"" he announced. ""So here I am. What's Poirot's take on our little predicament? Thinks it's all a hoax, like me?"" Poirot gazed up at the imposing actor, the two of them an odd pair. ""Whether hoax or not, Mr. Rolf,"" he remarked wryly, ""I've advised your wife against bringing the jewel to Yardly Chase on Friday."" ""Couldn't agree more, sir.”",1
"Upon reflection, Havering's encounter with the mysterious figure could be crucial to cracking the case. With her keen eye for detail, she might have observed something pivotal. I promptly penned a detailed letter to Poirot, elaborating on the situation. Additional pieces of evidence were included before I dispatched the correspondence. The bullet recovered matched a revolver in police possession. Moreover, Mr. Havering's alibi was corroborated, confirming his presence in London on the fateful night.",1
"The final response, conversely, is the cornerstone of my hypothesis.” I threw my hands up in defeat. “I surrender.” While traveling to London by train, Poirot wrote diligently for a brief period, sealing the outcome in an envelope. “This is for Inspector McNeil. We will drop it off at Scotland Yard on our way, and then head to the Rendezvous Restaurant, where Miss Esmée Farquhar has graciously agreed to join us for dinner.” “And Ridgeway?” “What of him?” inquired Poirot with a gleam in his eye.",1
"The Villa was shrouded in darkness, with everyone fast asleep. As we stood beneath Mrs. Renauld's open window, a cry for help shattered the stillness. A light flickered in a nearby room as a struggle ensued. Poirot sprang into action, scaling a tree with feline agility. I followed, watching as Cinderella, the acrobat, swung effortlessly towards the danger. In a daring rescue, she averted a tragedy just in time. The scene unfolded, revealing the sinister truth behind the murder of M. Renauld and the attempted murder of his wife. The pieces fell into place, leading us to the unexpected culprit, Marthe Daubreuil. Through a series of clever deductions, the mystery was unraveled, exposing the cold-blooded motives of a calculating killer.",1
"After lunch, Lawrence pulled me aside and inquired about my plans to visit him. ""No, I don't intend to. He can come here if he wishes to meet us."" Lawrence seemed hesitant, a mix of nerves and excitement evident in his demeanor. Intrigued, I probed, ""What's going on?"" ""There's nothing major, but, well, if you do go, could you relay a message to him?"" he lowered his voice to a whisper, ""I believe I've located the extra coffee cup!"" Poirot's cryptic note had slipped my mind, but now my interest was reignited.",1
"As we ascended the staircase, John glanced back at the dining-room entrance, speaking in a hushed tone: “What do you think will happen when these two come face to face?” I shrugged, feeling uncertain. “I instructed Mary to keep them separated if possible.” “Do you think she'll succeed?” “It's hard to say. Inglethorp himself probably won't be eager to meet her.” “You still have the keys, right, Poirot?” I inquired, as we arrived at the locked room. John took the keys from Poirot, unlocked the door, and we entered. The lawyer headed straight for the desk, with John trailing behind.",1
"""I have a feeling that you would know if I didn't tell the truth, so I might as well tell you everything from the start. What do you say, Julius?"" ""If you're determined, then go ahead and give me the facts,"" replied the American, who had been silent until now. ""Yes, please tell me everything,"" Sir James requested. ""I want to know who Tommy really is."" With that, Tuppence began her story, and the lawyer listened intently. ""Fascinating,"" he remarked once she had finished. ""Much of what you've said, my dear, I already knew. I have my own theories about this Jane Finn.""",1
"""Vandemeyer? You mentioned her, right?” “My dear, I believe I simply suggested that there were alternative opportunities available.” “Yes, I understand. But it was a clue, wasn’t it?” “Well, it may have been,” Sir James acknowledged seriously. “I want more information. I want to understand why you dropped a hint for me.” Sir James chuckled at her determination. “Imagine if the woman sues me for damaging her reputation?” “Naturally,” Tuppence replied. “I realize lawyers are excessively cautious. But can’t we start with 'without prejudice' and then speak freely?""",1
"Poirot reminded me that despite our encounters with the Big Four resulting in two murders, Halliday's abduction, and near-death experiences for both of us, they still seemed to have the upper hand. He reassured me, saying, ""They may laugh for now, Hastings, but as the proverb goes: 'He laughs best who laughs at the end.' Rest assured, the tables will turn."" Poirot then pointed out, ""Let's not forget, we are up against not just any criminal, but the second most brilliant mind in the world."" I chose not to feed into his ego by questioning the obvious.",1
"""The reason behind the blank label on the box is now clear,"" I pointed out. ""Surprisingly simple, isn't it? I'm amazed I didn't figure it out myself."" Poirot seemed distracted, gesturing towards Styles. ""Another discovery has been made over there,"" he mentioned. ""Mr. Wells informed me while we were heading upstairs."" ""What did they find?"" I inquired. ""In the boudoir desk, they uncovered Mrs. Inglethorp's pre-marriage will, leaving everything to Alfred Inglethorp. It seems to have been written around the time of their engagement. A shock to Wells and John Cavendish, no doubt.""",1
"""Giraud is in agreement with me, are you not, sir?"" Regardless of Giraud's true beliefs, he assumed the position without any visible reaction. Coolly and almost contemptuously, he responded: ""Indeed, I concur."" The crowd murmured in surprise and interest once more. ""But how absurd!"" exclaimed M. Hautet. ""To stab a man after he's already dead! Savage! Unprecedented! Perhaps driven by an insatiable hatred."" ""No, Judge,"" Poirot interjected. ""I suspect it was carried out with complete premeditation to make an impact."" ""What kind of impact?"" ""The kind of impact it almost achieved,"" replied Poirot enigmatically. M. Bex pondered for a moment. ""So, how did the man meet his end?"" ""He was not killed. He perished.""",1
"""You see, you are aware of an inconvenient amount. That's the general idea. I must confess I was caught off guard; but someone else wasn't."" ""Tommy,"" Tuppence murmured. ""Yes. Apparently when the opportune moment arrived to dispose of him, he outsmarted them. Nevertheless, I have some concerns about him."" ""Why?"" ""Because Julius Hersheimmer is Mr. Brown,"" Sir James remarked sarcastically. ""And it requires more than one individual and a gun to confront Mr. Brown."" Tuppence grew slightly pale. ""What should we do?"" ""Nothing until we've visited the residence in Soho. If Beresford is still in control, there's no need to worry.""",1
"""Twice Tommy shifted his gaze nervously. Julius glanced over. “What’s wrong?” “I’m not sure. I feel on edge for some reason. Keep thinking there might be someone trailing us.” “Impossible,” Julius stated firmly. “We’d notice.” Admittedly, Tommy had to agree. Nevertheless, his unease persisted. Despite himself, he couldn’t shake the belief in the enemy’s watchfulness. “I almost wish that guy would show up,” Julius remarked. He patted his pocket. “Little William here is itching for action!” “Do you always have it on you?” Tommy asked, consumed by curiosity.""",1
"As I turned the corner, I realized that despite having Cinderella's address, I was still clueless about her name. Inside the Salon, the examining magistrate was deep in conversation with the elderly gardener Auguste. Poirot and the commissary acknowledged my presence with a smile and a nod. Taking a seat discreetly, I observed M. Hautet's thorough and detailed questioning, yet he failed to uncover any significant information. Auguste confessed that the gardening gloves were his own, explaining that he used them when tending to a specific type of primula plant that was toxic to certain individuals.",1
"I was fully committed to the cause. Only two responses came in from the ads, but they were both dead ends. Both replies were from actors who had worked with Claud Darrell in the past, but neither could provide any substantial information. The mystery of Darrell's whereabouts remained unsolved. It wasn't until ten days later that I received another message from the Big Four. Walking through Hyde Park, deep in contemplation, I heard a voice call out to me. ""Captain Hastings, isn't it?"" A luxurious limousine had pulled up beside me, a woman peering out from inside with a charming foreign accent.",1
"""Forgive my impulsiveness, Philip,"" she began. ""Allow me to present Monsieur Hercule Poirot, a name you surely recognize, and his companion, Captain Hastings."" Ridgeway appeared taken aback. ""I am familiar with your reputation, Monsieur Poirot,"" he acknowledged, shaking hands. ""But I never suspected Esmée would seek your assistance with our dilemma."" ""I feared you would object, Philip,"" Miss Farquhar admitted softly. ""Hence my precautions,"" he replied, smiling.",1
"He returned to his original perspective. ""There's no point in debating the method. We're caught. We've come up short. I only have one option.""  ""What's that?""  ""Return to London immediately. Mr. Carter needs to be informed. It won't be long before everything unravels. But, at the very least, he deserves to know the truth.""  It was an unpleasant task, but Tommy refused to avoid it. He needed to confess his failure to Mr. Carter. Once that was done, his role was complete. Boarding the late night train to London, he left Julius to spend the night in Holyhead. Half an hour later, looking worn and pale, Tommy faced his superior.",1
"""In the tense atmosphere, he presented three delicate paper strips. ""A message penned by the killer's own hand, my friends! If only it had been more explicit, perhaps Mrs. Inglethorp could have evaded the danger with timely warning. Alas, she perceived the threat but not its method."" Amid the hushed air, Poirot meticulously arranged the paper fragments and, after a brief pause, recited: Dearest Evelyn: ‘Your worry about the silence is unnecessary. Everything is proceeding as planned, just delayed to tonight instead of last night. You know what to do. A brighter future awaits once the old lady is eliminated.",1
"""Yes, that’s true. It never occurred to me before."" I was taken aback. ""It's quite strange."" Poirot agreed. ""Right from the start, his actions have been unusual. Out of everyone in the household, he would be the most likely to identify the signs of strychnine poisoning, yet he is the only one adamant about the death being from natural causes. If it were Monsieur John, I could see why. He lacks the expertise and isn't the most imaginative. But Monsieur Lawrence? No way! And today, he proposes an idea that he must have known was absurd.""",1
"In an instant, I brandished the gun concealed in my boot and pressed it against his temple. The pair of bodyguards by Harry’s side lunged forward, only to be halted by his commanding voice. “One more move and it’s over! Anne, pull the trigger if they dare to advance.” “I won’t hesitate,” I responded with a grin. “Actually, I’m quite nervous about using it.” I could tell that Sir Eustace shared my apprehension, as he trembled like a leaf. “Remain in your places,” he instructed, and the guards froze in their tracks. “Order them out of the room,” Harry demanded. Sir Eustace complied without hesitation.",1
"I had embarked from Southampton on the 17th, carrying a precious paper that bore the numbers 17, 1, and 22. My deduction was that 17 referred to Cabin 17 and 1 to one o'clock. As tomorrow was the 22nd, I was convinced that something significant would occur at 1 a.m. My evening was restless as I awaited the appointed hour. When it came, I heard the hurried footsteps of a man outside my cabin. Without hesitation, I concealed him from pursuers, all while maintaining the appearance of a lady washing her neck. The unexpected arrival of a stewardess provided a moment of tension, but the drunk intruder in my cabin turned out to have been stabbed. Despite his defiance, I tended to his wound, demanding no gratitude in return.",1
"Poirot carefully examined the dagger that had been removed from the wound, now resting in a glass jar beside the body. His eyes gleamed with excitement as he observed the lack of blood and stains on the clothes. ""This wound is strange,"" he remarked. ""The blade of the dagger is discoloured, but the man was stabbed after he was dead."" As the voices around him grew louder, Poirot silenced them with a gesture and turned to Giraud, ""M. le docteur, what are your thoughts on this?""",1
"“I wasn’t aware of it until later. He blended in with the crowd so well that I wouldn’t recognize him. Who is he really? I have no idea. But one thing I am certain of is that he is a man to be feared.” “He’ll never suspect,” remarked Julius. “He has knowledge of everything and his retribution is merciless. Even someone like me, Kramenin, would not be spared!” “So you won’t comply with my request?” “You’re asking for the impossible.” “Well, that’s unfortunate for you,” said Julius with a grin. “But it will be for the greater good of the world.” He aimed the gun. “Stop,” cried the Russian. “You wouldn’t actually shoot me, would you?” “Yes, I would.",1
"In the following day, newspapers across England will splash the headline: “UNSOLVED CRIME ROCKS ESSEX” “AFFLUENT WOMAN FALLEN VICTIM TO POISON” Expect images of Styles, candid snapshots of “The relatives exiting the Inquest” the local photographer had certainly been busy! These were all events that one typically reads about happening to others, never oneself. Yet here we were, faced with a homicide within these walls. Standing before us were “the lead investigators handling the situation.",1
"I inquired once more about my whereabouts, expressing concern that there was a crucial detail I needed to recall, though it eluded me. My agitation grew as I struggled to recollect. When he demanded to know my name, I confessed that my memory was completely blank. Abruptly, he seized my wrist and twisted it, causing excruciating pain. My screams echoed, yet he persisted. Desperately, I cried out phrases in French until, mercifully, I lost consciousness.",1
"I found myself in an unfamiliar bed, in a room that was equally foreign to me. There was a figure seated by the window, who then approached and stood beside me. It was Achille Poirot, or perhaps not. The unmistakable ironic tone in his voice erased any uncertainty. ""Indeed, my dear friend, it is I. Brother Achille has returned to the realm of legends. It has always been me. Number Four is not the only one capable of deception. Belladonna glinting in my eyes, the sacrifice of my moustache, and a genuine scar that still aches from the injury sustained two months prior. I could not afford a counterfeit under the watchful gaze of Number Four.""",1
"The detective adjusted his tie, fixing his gaze on my companion in a playful manner. “You don’t see eye to eye with me, do you? So, what aspect of the case stands out to you? I’m all ears.” “There is something that strikes me as significant. Tell me, Mr. Smith, does anything about this case ring a bell? Does it not remind you of something?” “Ring a bell? Remind me of something? I can’t think of anything at the moment. I don’t believe so, though.” “You are mistaken,” remarked Holmes calmly. “A crime very much like this one has occurred in the past.” “When? And where?” “Ah, that, regrettably, escapes me at present but I will soon recall it.”",1
"The cavity was empty save for one thing - a scrap of paper. Poirot's cry of ""Sacré!"" filled the air, his anger palpable. It was evident that someone had beaten us to it. We studied the paper intently, recognizing it as a piece of the puzzle we were trying to solve. Baker's signature was still partially visible, but the contents of the will were nowhere to be found. Poirot, sitting back in frustration, wore a puzzled expression that bordered on comical, if not for the seriousness of the situation. ""I do not comprehend,"" he muttered. ""Who would go to such lengths to destroy this, and for what purpose?"" ""The Bakers, perhaps?"" I suggested.",1
"""Patience is a virtue,"" I muttered. ""Hastings, always in a rush! But fear not, the wait won't be too lengthy. The man they feared the most, myself, is no longer a threat. I predict they have two to three months left."" The mention of someone being eliminated brought back memories of Ingles and his tragic demise. It dawned on me that I had never mentioned the dying Chinaman at St. Giles' Hospital to Poirot. He listened intently as I recounted the tale. ""Ingles's servant, you say? And he spoke a few words in Italian? Interesting.""",1
"""Listen, sir."" ""I would rather not speak in front of Miss Daubreuil."" ""As my daughter mentioned, she is not a child."" The magistrate paused, unsure for a moment. ""Alright, ma'am,"" he finally said. ""Let's do it your way. We suspect that you used to visit the deceased at his Villa in the evenings. Is that true?"" The lady's cheeks blushed slightly, but she responded calmly: ""I refuse to answer that question!"" ""Madam, we are investigating a homicide."" ""So what? I was not involved in the murder."" ""Madam, we are not implying that. However, you were acquainted with the deceased man.""",1
"""Hello, Evie, look who's here - our injured hero, Mr. Hastings. Miss Howard."" Evie greeted Miss Howard with a firm handshake, almost too firm. I noticed her piercing blue eyes set in a weathered complexion. She appeared to be a woman in her forties, with a commanding voice that bordered on masculine, and a solid, square frame matched by sturdy boots. Her words were brief and to the point. ""Weeds are growing rapidly. Can't keep up. Will need your help. Be cautious."" ""I would be more than happy to assist,"" I replied. ""Actions speak louder.""",1
"“Are you positive it was the same one?” “Absolutely sure. That’s what makes it so perplexing.” “Nothing is out of the realm of possibility. Perhaps there were two identical daggers.” I arched my eyebrows. “That seems incredibly unlikely. It would be an extraordinary stroke of luck.” “You are too hasty in your judgment, Hastings. In certain circumstances, having two of the same weapons would not be so far-fetched. This specific dagger was a custom creation ordered by Jack Renauld. When you really consider it, it is quite improbable that he would have commissioned only one.”",1
"""Potter as per usual?"" ""That works for me!"" a voice chimed in, with a hint of transatlantic flair, ""but I must mention, it's becoming a tad tricky. The support isn't what it used to be, and there's a trend to allow the Irish to handle their issues without any meddling from America."" Tommy sensed Boris may have shrugged as he replied: ""Does it really make a difference, considering the funds are just a front from the US?"" ""The real challenge lies in smuggling the weapons,"" the Sinn Feiner stated.",1
"I heard her voice next, clear and sharp, tinged with a hint of an exotic accent: ‘Marlow, The Mill House. Belongs to Sir Eustace Pedler. I think it might be just right for me. I'll pay a visit.’ The man handed her a note and she sauntered out, exuding an air of royalty. She didn't acknowledge Carton in any way, yet I had a feeling their encounter was planned. My mind raced with assumptions. Unaware that Sir Eustace was in Cannes, I suspected this house hunt was a ruse to rendezvous with him at the Mill House.",1
"Tuppence locked eyes with Mrs. Vandemeyer, her voice low and steady: ""Money."" The older woman's reaction was immediate. ""What do you mean by that?"" Tuppence didn't hesitate. ""A long memory is nothing compared to a deep purse. Planning revenge might make you feel better, but it's not practical. Everyone knows that. But money,"" she paused, emphasizing her point, ""money is always satisfying."" Mrs. Vandemeyer scoffed, ""Do you really think I would betray my friends?"" Tuppence's response was swift and unwavering.",1
"“Ladies and gentlemen,” declared Poirot dramatically, “allow me to present to you the culprit, Mr. Alfred Inglethorp!” I could feel the anger rising within me. “Poirot, you conniving scoundrel,” I exclaimed, “I am tempted to throttle you! How could you betray me like this?” The scene unfolded in the dimly lit library, the aftermath of intense days of investigation. Downstairs, John and Mary had reconciled, while Alfred Inglethorp and Miss Howard were now in police custody. Finally alone with Poirot, I seized the opportunity to satisfy my relentless curiosity. Poirot remained silent for a moment, then calmly replied: “I did not betray you, my friend.",1
"""I was debating whether to immediately exonerate John Cavendish. While I could have cleared him, it may have hindered the prosecution of the true culprits. They remained clueless about my true intentions until the very end, contributing to my triumph.""  ""Wait, are you saying you had the power to prevent John Cavendish from facing trial?""  ""Indeed, my friend. Yet, I ultimately chose 'a woman's happiness' over his innocence. Only the grave peril they endured could reunite these two haughty spirits.""  I stared at Poirot in stunned silence.",1
"The man stood out like a sore thumb, with his striking black beard and tendency to wear shiny patent leather boots regardless of the weather. Despite being an outsider, he quickly gained the favor of the mater, who had a habit of taking on secretaries due to her involvement in numerous societies. With the war escalating, the number of societies she was involved in multiplied, making the man's assistance even more valuable.",1
"""I’ve been the most idiotic fool imaginable. Relax” Tommy made a quick gesture “I’m heading straight to the London and North Western Railway depot, if you must know.” “I couldn’t care less where you’re off to,” grumbled Tommy. When Julius left, he went back to his luggage. “That’s everything,” he muttered, then buzzed for assistance. “Bring my bags down.” “Of course. Leaving town, sir?” “I’m off to hell,” declared Tommy, unconcerned with the servant's reaction. The servant simply replied: “Understood, sir.",1
"And then, simply walk out! If he crossed paths with anyone on the way down, well Tommy brightened at the idea of a physical altercation. Such an incident suited him much better than the verbal confrontation of earlier. Excited by his scheme, Tommy carefully removed the picture of the Devil and Faust, and positioned himself. His optimism was sky-high. The plan appeared to him straightforward yet brilliant. Time passed, but Conrad was nowhere to be seen. Day and night blended together in this cell, yet Tommy’s wrist-watch, which prided itself on being accurate, showed that it was nine o’clock at night.",1
"""Wait a second, is there an entrance to Miss Cynthia’s chambers?” “Indeed, but it’s consistently locked. It’s never been opened.” “Let’s check it out.” He hurried down the hallway to Cynthia’s quarters. Mary Cavendish was already there, gently shaking the girl who appeared to be a deep sleeper, attempting to rouse her. Soon enough, he returned. “No luck. That’s locked as well. We’ll have to force the door open. This one seems slightly less sturdy than the one in the hallway.” Together, we pushed and pulled with all our might.",1
"""It appeared she was unable to tear her gaze away from Race. She approached me this evening, hesitatingly mentioning a favor she wished to request. Could I manage her keepsakes on her behalf? ""Not the creatures?"" I exclaimed, filled with sudden dread. I had always feared being burdened with those dreadful animals eventually. After some negotiation, we reached an agreement. I agreed to safeguard two delicate items in small wooden boxes for her. The animals will be carefully packed by the nearby shop into large crates and shipped to Cape Town by train, where Pagett will arrange for their storage.""",1
"“Can you give any details about him?” “I didn’t really pay attention. He seemed like just an average guy.” Mr. Carter let out a weary sigh. “That’s always the same description of Mr. Brown! Delivered a phone message to Whittington, did he? See a telephone in the reception area?” Tuppence pondered. “I don’t recall seeing one.” “Precisely. That so-called ‘message’ was Mr. Brown’s way of issuing instructions to his underling. He eavesdropped on the entire conversation, no doubt. Was it right after that Whittington handed you the cash and arranged for your return the next day?” Tuppence confirmed.",1
"""I'm asking you once more, are you willing to compose this note?"" ""Absolutely not, and let me remind you, you wouldn't dare harm me. The authorities would be alerted in an instant."" Suddenly, my conversation partner clapped his hands. Two attendants of Chinese descent emerged seemingly out of nowhere, and restrained me by gripping both of my arms. Speaking quickly in Chinese, their employer directed them to haul me to a specific location in the expansive room. One of the attendants bent down, and unexpectedly, the ground beneath my feet collapsed.",1
"“Hot chocolate, maybe with a hint of rum.” He moved on to the mess on the ground, where the nightstand had been knocked over. A desk lamp, a stack of books, some matches, a set of keys, and the shattered remains of a mug were strewn across the floor. “Hmm, quite intriguing,” remarked Poirot. “I fail to see what is so intriguing about it.” “Don’t you? Look at the lamp, the glass is shattered in two spots; they are right where they fell. And yet, the mug is completely pulverized.” “Hmm,” I sighed, “I suppose someone must have accidentally stepped on it.”",1
"""As an example, on the night he attempted to push me off the ship, the Kilmorden, he claims that he followed Rayburn onto the deck and got knocked down by Rayburn. We now understand that this is false."" ""Yes,"" Suzanne admitted reluctantly. ""But we only received the account indirectly from Sir Eustace. If we had heard it directly from Pagett himself, the narrative might have been altered. People tend to distort a story slightly when they pass it on."" I pondered the situation. ""No,"" I finally replied, ""I can't find a way around it. Pagett is guilty.""",1
"Afterwards, Tommy begrudgingly acknowledged the grim outlook. The future's troubles paled in comparison to the present ones. The immediate and overwhelming concern was hunger. Tommy had a robust appetite. The steak and chips he had for lunch felt like a distant memory. He sadly realized that a hunger strike was not in his best interest. He wandered aimlessly in his confinement. He even resorted to banging on the door a couple of times, abandoning his pride. However, no one responded to his calls. ""This is outrageous!"" Tommy exclaimed. ""Surely they don't intend to let me starve to death.""",1
"“I’ve come to discuss a matter of great importance with you, privately,” he stated, glancing at the other man. “My assistant, Mr. Smith, is aware of all my affairs.”  “That may be the case, but I have my own secrets,” replied Marcus dryly. “So please ask him to leave.”  “John,” Marcus said in a low voice, “would you mind waiting in the adjacent chamber?”  “The next room is not suitable,” Marcus interjected. “I am familiar with these grand suites and I need this one completely empty, with only you and I. Send him out to purchase a small bag of peanuts.”  Although not fond of the American's casual way of speaking, Ivan was consumed by curiosity.",1
"In his hand he held a leg of lamb! ""My dear Poirot!"" I exclaimed. ""What's wrong? Have you lost your mind?"" ""Look, I beg you, at this lamb. But look at it carefully!"" I examined it closely, but could not spot anything out of the ordinary. It appeared to be a very typical leg of lamb. I voiced my observation. Poirot shot me a scornful look. ""But can't you see this and this and this?"" He pointed out each ""this"" with a poke at the innocent joint, causing small ice chips to fall off.",1
"""But much to my surprise, I suddenly heard a faint sound coming from the deck behind me, followed by his calm and friendly voice: “Miss Beddingfeld.” “Yes?” I spun around. “I must offer you my sincerest apologies. My behavior last night was completely uncalled for.” “It was quite an unusual evening,” I replied quickly. It wasn't the most coherent response, but it was all I could muster. “Can you find it in yourself to forgive me?” I extended my hand silently. He accepted it. “There is another matter I need to address.” His expression grew more serious.""",1
"The man tending to the garden was clearly agitated by our presence, but begrudgingly agreed to assist us. After an unbearable delay, he presented us with some stale pastries and lukewarm tea before retreating back to his gardening. As soon as he left, a swarm of hungry cats surrounded us, meowing incessantly. Feeling sorry for the starving creatures, I offered them bits of cake which they devoured eagerly. Pouring what little milk we had into a saucer caused the cats to fight over it ferociously. ""They're clearly malnourished!"" I exclaimed in outrage.",1
"""Shh! No more talking for now."" John led us into his study and shut the door. Mr. Wells, a friendly middle-aged man with sharp eyes and the typical mouth of a lawyer, welcomed us. John made introductions and explained why we were there. ""You understand, Wells,"" he said, ""this must remain confidential. We are hopeful that further investigation will not be necessary."" ""Of course, of course,"" Mr. Wells reassured. ""We had hoped to spare you the pain and attention of an inquest, but without a doctor's certificate, it is unavoidable.""",1
"I rushed to the lodge gates where the car awaited me.  ""Can you describe the events that followed?""  Upon entering Mrs. Inglethorp's room, I found her in the midst of a severe convulsion.  As she looked at me, she managed to utter: ""Alfred, Alfred.""  ""Is it plausible that the strychnine was added to Mrs. Inglethorp's post-dinner coffee by her husband?""  ""It is possible, however strychnine acts quickly, showing symptoms within one to two hours of ingestion.""",1
"""Such a despicable man! He has ensnared my dear John in a web of lies! Twisting every detail until reality is distorted,"" she exclaimed.  ""Don't worry,"" I reassured her, ""the truth will come out tomorrow.""  ""Yes,"" she mused, then lowered her voice suddenly. ""Mr. Hastings, you don't think... it couldn't have been Lawrence. No, that's impossible!"" But doubts lingered in my mind, and once alone with Poirot, I inquired about Sir Ernest's intentions.  ""Ah!"" Poirot exclaimed, impressed. ""Sir Ernest is quite astute, isn't he.""",1
"""Nature rebelled. Na ture re belled.” Dr. Bauerstein noticed that the local doctor was being closely observed. He maintained his gaze on the doctor while speaking. “The convulsions were unusually violent, Dr. Wilkins. I regret that you missed witnessing them. They displayed a distinctly tetanic nature.” “Ah!” Dr. Wilkins nodded knowingly. “I would like to have a private conversation with you,” Dr. Bauerstein stated. Turning to John, he asked, “Do you mind?” “Not at all.” The group exited to the corridor, leaving the two doctors alone, and I heard the lock click behind us as we descended the stairs.",1
"""Mrs. Vandemeyer arched her eyebrows. “Today is Friday! But I assume you have no intentions of leaving the house, given that you just arrived yesterday.” “Actually, I was hoping to ask for permission, ma’am.” Mrs. Vandemeyer studied her for a moment, then grinned. “I wish Count Stepanov could witness this. He mentioned you last night.” Her grin widened, resembling that of a cat. “Your request is quite characteristic. I am content. You may not grasp the significance, but feel free to go out today. It matters little to me, as I will not be home for dinner.",1
"I had been waiting for this moment. I was cautious, resisting the urge to react impulsively. Slowly, I succumbed to the pressure and coercion. Under Sir Eustace's guidance, I penned a letter: Dearest Harry, there is a glimmer of hope to prove your innocence unequivocally. Follow my directives precisely. Visit Agrasato's antique store. Request to view something ""uncommon,"" ""for a special event."" The proprietor will invite you to the ""rear chamber."" Accompany him. A messenger will be waiting to escort you to me. Obey his every command. Remember to bring the diamonds along.",1
"Just as he approached him, the man glanced quickly up and down the street, then took a small item from his pocket and tossed it over the fence before continuing on to the station. The 'chink' of the object hitting the ground piqued the interest of a man in the ditch, who found a ring. Kellett claims this story, but Lowen denies it vehemently. There is a possibility that he encountered Davenheim in the lane, but Poirot finds it highly unlikely. Japp agrees, noting that Lowen's actions seem odd. Poirot suggests that the ring could have been planted near the scene. Japp mentions a lime kiln nearby that could have been used to dispose of the body. Poirot contemplates the situation, leaving Japp and the narrator puzzled.",1
"""No. 20. Goes by the name Vandemeyer. Vandemeyer! Ha! ha!” Albert’s hand reached for his pocket. “A criminal?” he asked eagerly. “A criminal? Absolutely. Ready Rita they call her in the States.” “Ready Rita,” Albert repeated excitedly. “Oh, it’s just like in the movies!” Tuppence was a regular at the cinema. “Annie always warned that she was trouble,” the boy added. “Who's Annie?” Tuppence asked casually. “House-parlourmaid. She's leaving today. Annie has told me many times: ‘Mark my words, Albert, I wouldn't be surprised if the police come after her one day.’ Just like that.""",1
"""His demeanor remained composed as he penned the letter, yet in a sudden burst of emotion, he hastily wrote those four frantic words."" Disagreeing, my companion vigorously shook his head. ""You are mistaken. Can you not see that while the signature ink is dark, the postscript ink is faint?"" Perplexed, I replied, ""And?"" ""Ah, my friend, engage your intellect! Is it not clear? M. Renauld composed his letter, read it over without smudging, then, with intent, included those final words before blotting the page.""",1
"""Take a look at this, my friend."" My gaze immediately fell on the signature, ""Abe Ryland,"" and I couldn't help but remember Poirot's description: ""the wealthiest man alive."" The letter from Mr. Ryland was short and to the point. He made it clear that he was extremely unhappy with Poirot's decision to back out of the deal in South America at the last minute. ""This really makes you wonder, doesn't it?"" remarked Poirot. ""I suppose it's understandable that he's a little irritated."" ""No, no, you don't understand. Think back to the words of Mayerling, the man who sought shelter here only to meet his demise at the hands of his enemies.""",1
"Poirot and I arrived at the Villa Geneviève to find a chaos of questions surrounding the murder of Mr. Renauld. The body was found in an open grave, a shocking discovery that raised more questions than answers. The servants, including the old housekeeper Françoise, were questioned about the events of the night, but it seemed that there was more to the story than met the eye. The mysterious lady who visited Mr. Renauld on the night of the murder added another layer of intrigue to the case. As we delved deeper into the investigation, it became clear that there were secrets hidden within the walls of the Villa Geneviève, waiting to be uncovered.",1
"I recall the man who had pretended to be Sir Eustace. He was sly, but charming in his own way. Colonel Race was determined to see justice served, though I had my doubts. The man had a network of spies and a well-planned escape route. Despite my lukewarm response, the conversation shifted to Harry's innocence. Colonel Race revealed Harry's true identity, leaving me stunned. Harry confessed his deception, fearing my reaction. As I processed his story, discrepancies emerged. He explained the tragic fate of his friend Lucas and the reasons for his deception. Harry's true motives were finally laid bare, leaving me conflicted. I couldn't help but feel a pang of regret that the truth had come to light.",1
"I've been in this business a long time, and I've learned to trust my instincts. You have to be one step ahead of the game, always ready for the unexpected. The key is to keep your eyes open and your mind sharp, never letting your guard down. That's how you stay alive in this world of shadows and secrets. The truth is, you never know who's watching, who's waiting to strike. That's why you have to be ready for anything, even when it comes from the most unlikely sources. It's a dangerous game we play, but it's the only one I know how to win.",1
"""I'll be fine,"" Tuppence snapped, her usual aversion to pity evident. Julius inquired about marriage, asking for her views on the matter. ""I plan to marry,"" Tuppence replied confidently. ""That is, if I can find someone wealthy enough to make it worthwhile. That's honest, isn't it? You probably look down on me for it."" Julius responded, ""I never underestimate business instinct."" Tuppence, confused, asked, ""Figure? Do you mean tall or short?""",1
"“There is a certain notoriety given to these cases. And the girl was very young nineteen, I believe. It seemed a pity that her infirmity should be talked about might damage her prospects. Besides, there is no special treatment to pursue in such cases. It is really a matter of waiting.” “Waiting?” “Yes, sooner or later, the memory will return as suddenly as it went. But in all probability the girl will have entirely forgotten the intervening period, and will take up life where she left off at the sinking of the Lusitania. The twists and turns of fate are unpredictable, much like the tides of the ocean.",1
"He then commanded me abruptly to abandon any notion of marriage. He adamantly refused to approve of such a union. Irritated, I inquired about his objections to Mademoiselle Daubreuil. He had no valid explanation, only disparaging comments about the secretive past of the mother and daughter. I insisted that I was marrying Marthe, not her family history, but he silenced me with a firm rejection of any further discussion. The marriage was to be called off.",1
"""I would have much rather preferred to operate in the shadows temporarily, but what you're suggesting is fair. The testimony of a retired Belgian detective is not sufficient! Alfred Inglethorp cannot be taken into custody. I have made a vow to that effect, as my companion Hastings can confirm. So, my dear Japp, are you heading to Styles immediately?"" ""Well, in roughly thirty minutes. We need to speak with the Coroner and the doctor first."" ""Excellent. Swing by the last residence in the village and pick me up. I will accompany you. At Styles, Mr. Inglethorp will present you with evidence, or if he declines, which is likely, I will provide you with such convincing proof that will dispel any doubts regarding the accusations against him.""",1
"“Have you looked into Lowen's connection to Davenheim on the night in question?”“Yes, it appears that Lowen and Davenheim had a strained relationship. Lowen, a small-time speculator, managed to outsmart Davenheim in the market a few times, despite rarely meeting in person. The meeting was related to South American shares, prompting Davenheim to schedule it.”“Did Davenheim have investments in South America?”“It seems likely. Mrs. Davenheim shared that he had spent the previous fall in Buenos Ayres.”",1
"""Pardon me, madame, but may I inquire about the nature of the business in Buenos Ayres?” Mrs. Renauld turned to face him, her expression guarded. “I am afraid I do not possess such knowledge, Monsieur Poirot. However, Buenos Ayres is merely a stepping stone for my son, his true destination being Santiago.” The mention of Santiago seemed to trigger a reaction in both the magistrate and the commissary, who simultaneously exclaimed, “Santiago! Once again, Santiago!” Poirot, who had been lost in thought near the window, approached Mrs. Renauld with a respectful nod, his mind seemingly elsewhere.",1
"His accomplices may have used a different method to incapacitate him, for example, they could have threatened him with a weapon instead. The Police Inspector and Major Norman discuss the possibility that the Prime Minister might have been kidnapped rather than escaped. They decide to return to England to investigate further. Poirot explains that the Prime Minister was kidnapped on his way to London, and a clever scheme involving a fake double was used to deceive the public.",1
"""But we caught him in Antwerp, all thanks to Mr. Poirot here."" While they chatted, I approached and was introduced to Detective-Inspector Japp, who then presented us to his partner, Superintendent Summerhaye. ""I doubt I need to inquire about your purpose here, gentlemen,"" Poirot commented. Japp winked knowingly. ""No need. Looks like an open-and-shut case to me."" Poirot, however, responded solemnly: ""I must disagree with you on that."" ""Oh, really?"" Summerhaye chimed in, speaking up for the first time. ""Seems pretty straightforward to me. The man was caught in the act.""",1
"""So you're interested in getting involved in this investigation?"" ""I must confess, you've piqued my curiosity quite skillfully."" ""Excellent. It's good to see you distracted from your deep thoughts. Captain Hastings seems pleased as well."" ""Absolutely,"" I chuckled. Poirot shifted his focus back to the victim. ""Any other small detail you can share about him?"" he inquired. ""I can't think of anything."" ""Not even that he favored his left hand?"" ""You truly are a master detective, Monsieur Poirot. How did you figure that out? He was left-handed. Although it seems irrelevant to the case."" ""Completely unrelated,"" Poirot quickly agreed, noticing Japp's slight annoyance.",1
"Anne Beddingfeld was relentless in her pursuit of the criminal, determined to claim the glory of his discovery for herself and the Daily Budget. Despite my warnings about the unwomanly nature of her actions, she laughed them off, certain that capturing him would secure her fortune.

They think Mr. Renauld was involved with a Madame Daubreuil who lives next door."" Mrs. Renauld blushed deeply, her expression changing rapidly. Stonor watched her, surprised by her reaction, while M. Hautet remained silent.",1
"""Of course, it's clear that M. Renauld was involved with the Englishwoman Bella. He arrives, meets Madame Daubreuil, and starts a relationship with her. When he loses interest, she becomes suspicious. This letter is a definite threat. Initially, the case seemed simple - jealousy! The fact that M. Renauld was stabbed in the back initially pointed to a crime committed by a woman."" Poirot agreed. ""Yes, the backstabbing, sure. But the grave! That took effort, it was hard work. No woman could have dug that grave, sir. That was the work of a man."" The commissary responded eagerly: ""Absolutely, you're correct.""",1

Poirot gave a knowing look. “You see, you hit a roadblock immediately. Why would Madame Daubreuil (for clarity’s sake, let’s refer to her as such) want to kill M. Renauld?

This is the question Number Four is pondering right now. He cannot afford to take any chances. I must be eliminated at any cost. Well, let him attempt to eliminate Hercule Poirot! I will be prepared for his every move."" With those final words, the individual at the adjacent table stood up and left.",1
"“I can assure you, I know nothing about him,” I said quickly. “He appeared out of nowhere in London, managed to steal important documents that will undoubtedly cause me trouble, and vanished mysteriously in Cape Town. While he was at the Falls, I was at the hotel and he was on an island. I never crossed paths with him during that time.” I took a moment to collect myself. “I believe you are mistaken. I was referring to your second secretary.” “What? Pagett?” I exclaimed, shocked.",1
"As I made my way inside, I was taken aback by the sight before me. It was like stepping into a scene from the Arabian Nights - a lavish palace hidden underground. The chamber was adorned with luxurious oriental silks, bathed in a warm glow from the lights, and filled with the intoxicating scents of perfumes and spices. Silk-covered divans and intricately designed Chinese carpets lined the floor, creating an atmosphere of opulence. A mysterious voice echoed from a curtained alcove at the far end of the room. ""Has our esteemed guest arrived?"" the voice inquired. ""Yes, Excellency, he is here,"" answered my escort. ""Then, please, show our guest in,"" came the command.",1
"I overheard an interesting conversation between Sir Eustace and another man about cabin allocations. Sir Eustace was adamant about not sharing his cabin, which led to a heated dispute with other passengers. In the end, the purser confirmed that Cabin 17 was mine, and the others had to choose between Nos. 13 and 28. I settled in, only to be greeted by a terrible smell in the cabin - asafœtida. It seemed someone was desperate to get me out of there, but why? The mystery of Cabin 17 continued to intrigue me.",1
"""I've already mentioned it to Mary. But she's a typical woman, always wanting to be the center of attention when it comes to jewelry."" ""That's absurd, Gregory!"" Mary Marvell snapped back, her face turning red with anger. Poirot raised his shoulders in a shrug. ""Madam, I have given my advice. That is all I can do. It is finished."" He escorted them to the door and then returned. ""Ah! Women's stories! The good husband, though lacking tact, hit the nail on the head. Definitely."" I shared my vague recollections with him, and he nodded in agreement. ""Just as I suspected. However, there is something peculiar lurking beneath the surface of all this.""",1
"""Poor Maltravers! You had no idea, I gather, that he was discovered with a crowbar next to him."" ""So you're saying my tale influenced him - oh, that's terrible!"" ""Don't worry, it would have happened regardless. Now, I need to make a call to London."" Poirot had an extensive discussion on the phone, returning with a pensive expression. He disappeared on his own for the rest of the afternoon, only reappearing at seven o’clock to reveal that he could delay it no more, and had to deliver the tragic news to the grieving widow.",1
"“Don’t worry, once he’s captured, you’ll be safe.” Fear washed over Mrs. Vandemeyer’s face. “Do you promise? Will I truly be safe?” She tightly grasped Tuppence’s arm. “The money, are you certain?” “Absolutely certain.” “When can I expect it? I cannot afford any delays.” “My associate will arrive soon. He may need to send urgent messages. But rest assured, there will be no delays - he's incredibly efficient.” A determined expression formed on Mrs. Vandemeyer’s face. “I agree to it.”",1
"I placed him in an upstairs bedroom in my residence, with plans to interrogate him the following day, a decision that, in hindsight, was rather foolish."" Poirot pressed, ""How was he captured?"" ""That, I will never uncover. I awoke that evening to my home engulfed in flames, barely surviving the ordeal. Upon investigation, it was determined that a remarkably fierce fire had ignited on the highest level, leaving behind only the charred remains of my youthful acquaintance."" It was evident from the intense manner in which he had recounted the tale that Mr.",1
"“What is your take on that?” I remained silent. I chuckled. Deep down, I was aware of the imminent danger. In that moment, he despised me. Yet, I found myself drawn to the danger, reveling in the sensation of his hands around my throat. I wouldn't trade that moment for anything else. With a brief chuckle, he let go of me. ""What's your name?"" he inquired abruptly. ""Anne Beddingfeld."" ""Is there nothing that scares you, Anne Beddingfeld?"" ""Oh, indeed,"" I responded, trying to appear composed despite feeling otherwise. ""Wasps, snarky women, overly young men, cockroaches, and condescending store clerks."" He chuckled briefly once more. Then, he nudged the unconscious Pagett with his foot.",1
"""I couldn't have told you,"" he said. ""It was necessary for the plan to work. But don't think I didn't consider your feelings. I did it to protect you. After the explosion, I came up with a brilliant idea. Ridgeway played his part perfectly. Now, everyone believes I'm dead and you can safely go back to South America. But I knew you wouldn't leave. So, I had to go through the charade of a solicitor's letter and a long explanation.""",1
"""I ask you, what was the conclusion of that message? Please repeat it for me,"" he requested.  ""'Locate the spare coffee mug, and you will find peace.' Do you truly have no idea what it signifies?"" I inquired with concern.  He pondered for a moment before responding, ""No, I'm afraid I do not. I wish I did.""  The sound of the gong resonated from the nearby house, signaling it was time to go inside. Poirot had been invited to stay for lunch by John, and was already seated at the dining table.  Without speaking of the recent tragedy, we engaged in conversation about the ongoing war and other external matters.  However, as soon as the cheese and crackers were passed around and Dorcas exited the room, Poirot leaned in closer to Mrs.",1
"""Look, here he comes pushing his wheelbarrow.” It was clear that an older gentleman was making his way across the driveway with a load of seedlings. Poirot signaled to him, causing the man to stop and shuffle towards us. “Are you planning to request one of his boots to compare against the footprints?” I inquired eagerly. My confidence in Poirot started to return. If he deemed the footprints in the right-hand bed significant, then they must be. “Precisely,” responded Poirot. “But wouldn’t he find it rather strange?” “He won’t give it a second thought.",1
"""The conflict took a different turn, leading to a shift in the political landscape and the agreement remained untouched. Speculations of its existence were vehemently dismissed. Jane Finn's disappearance faded from memory and the entire incident was consigned to oblivion."" Mr. Carter paused, prompting Tuppence to interject impatiently, ""But why is it resurfacing now? The war is long gone."" A flicker of alertness appeared in Mr. Carter's demeanor. ""Because it appears that the documents were never truly obliterated, and now they could resurface with a fresh and dangerous significance."" Tuppence was taken aback. Mr.",1
"During our brief encounter, it was evident that he was a coward at heart. Without delay, I saw the fear in his eyes as we locked gazes. With little effort, I coerced him into revealing his involvement in the robbery scheme and disclosed that Anita Grünberg was his estranged wife. Their paths had crossed with mine at a hotel dinner, where my unexpected presence had shaken him to the core after believing me to be dead. Despite marrying young, Anita had grown distant from him over time.",1
"“Ah, you played your hand well, I’ll give you that. But mark my words, there will be a reckoning for your actions. I have a memory that doesn’t forget,” the woman threatened. Tuppence, unimpressed, retorted, “I must say, I expected more from someone like you. Did you truly believe I would beg for mercy on the ground?” With a sinister smile, the woman replied, “Perhaps one day you will.” Despite the icy tone, Tuppence remained composed. “Shall we take a seat?” she suggested calmly. “This dramatic stance is unnecessary. Not on the bed, please. Pull up a chair to the table, thank you.”",1
"""I don't get it. Why did Mr. Brown save us?"" ""Did Julius Hersheimmer help you get away?"" Tuppence described the evening's events to Sir James, finishing with: ""But I just don't understand!"" ""Don't you? I do. So does young Beresford, based on what he's done. Jane Finn was meant to escape as a last resort, without suspecting a setup. They don't mind if young Beresford stays close by and contacts you if needed. They'll make sure he disappears at the right moment.""",1
"“I should have remembered it if it was.” “Imagine if a package showed up with Mr. Lawrence Cavendish's name on it, only to vanish later on. Would you even notice it was missing?” “No, I doubt it. I would assume someone had taken it.” “It seems, Miss Howard, that you were the one who discovered this brown paper?” He displayed the same grimy piece that Poirot and I had inspected in the morning-room at Styles. “Yes, that was me.” “How did you end up searching for it?” “The Belgian detective working on the case requested that I find it.""",1
"Tuppence, with her keen eyes, caught sight of a threepenny detective novel peeking out of Albert's pocket. The widening of his eyes confirmed her suspicions that he took the bait. ""American Detective Force!"" she whispered. Albert took the bait. ""Lord!"" he exclaimed. Tuppence gestured knowingly. ""Know my target?"" she asked with a smile. Albert, wide-eyed, asked eagerly: ""One of the flats?"" Tuppence nodded and motioned towards the stairs.",1
"""Can you tell me the name of the young lady?"" inquired Mr. Hersheimmer. ""I can't recall,"" Sir James interjected, ""but it's not important. She would have likely used a different name. Do you happen to know a Mrs. Vandemeyer?"" ""Mrs. Vandemeyer from 20 South Audley Mansions? I've met her before."" ""Are you aware of the recent events?"" ""What events?"" ""Mrs. Vandemeyer has passed away."" ""Oh my, I had no clue! When did this happen?"" ""She overdosed on chloral last night."" ""Intentionally?"" ""It's unclear, but most likely accidental. I can't say for certain.""",1
"As he slowly regained consciousness, a sharp pain pulsed in his temples, causing him to wince. The room around him was unfamiliar, shrouded in darkness. Panic set in as he struggled to piece together what had transpired. This was definitely not the luxurious confines of his usual accommodations. With a curse under his breath, he attempted to rise, memories flooding back. He was inside that foreboding building in the heart of Soho. As he feigned stillness, a voice nearby observed his awakening, sending a chill down his spine. It was unmistakably the voice of the bearded German man who had orchestrated his capture.",1
"She confides in Dorcas, 'I am at a loss; marital scandal is a grave matter.' At four, she is composed despite her anger. By five, she is in distress, claiming a profound shock. ""Analyzing the situation, I made a deduction that I believed to be accurate. The second 'scandal' she mentioned was different from the first, and it involved herself! ""Let's piece it together. At four, Mrs. Inglethorp argues with her son, warning to expose him to his wife who, incidentally, heard most of the exchange.",1
"Nadina proudly revealed her cunning plan to the Count, explaining how she had outsmarted the 'Colonel' by keeping back some unique South American diamonds as leverage. She confidently declared that she was not afraid of the 'Colonel,' dismissing any concern about being blackmailed. The Count warned her of the dangers of underestimating their adversary, but Nadina was confident in her abilities. She mentioned a man arriving from Africa at her request, who had carried out her orders and happened to be her husband. The Count questioned her about the man's trustworthiness, to which Nadina responded with a mysterious smile.",1
"He journeyed through the countryside, eager to reach his destination before the day grew hot. In the early hours, he commanded his assistants to prepare the mules for travel. Despite the animals' initial resistance, they were eventually ready to depart. The mules surged forward at a rapid pace, and as dawn broke, the reason became clear. Unbeknownst to them in the darkness, a lion had been harnessed as the lead mule. This revelation sparked amusement among the group, although the Labour Member's grave reaction hinted at a deeper concern.",1
"""He was undoubtedly cunning, almost too cunning for us to handle. I must admit, he was the one in control. I paid my respects at the funeral with a grand display of crimson roses, symbolizing my personality."" I sat quietly, feeling a sense of unease. ""You resemble a stubborn mule ready to kick. Consider yourself warned. The next warning will be from the Destroyer."" With a gesture, she left in a hurry. I half-heartedly took note of the car's number, knowing it likely wouldn't amount to anything.",1
"""Ah, finally done. André, is that you? Inez here. The Belgian is onto everything. Get Halliday to the hotel, and let's get out."" With a smile, she hung up the phone and turned to us. ""You're coming with us to the hotel, madame."" ""Of course. I saw that coming."" I hailed a cab, and we set off. Poirot looked puzzled, almost too easy. At the hotel, the porter approached. ""A man just arrived. He's in your rooms, very sick. A nurse was here but she's gone.""",1
"""Unfortunately, she was found deceased this morning.” “Tragic. A remarkably attractive woman. I assume she was an acquaintance of yours, given your familiarity with these specifics.” “I am aware of the specifics because, in fact, I was the one who discovered her deceased.” “Is that so,” the doctor responded, taken aback. “Yes,” Sir James confirmed, rubbing his chin thoughtfully. “While this news is indeed sorrowful, I fail to see its relevance to your investigation.” “It is relevant in this manner, did Mrs. Vandemeyer entrust a young family member of hers to your care?” Julius inquired eagerly.""",1
"""The most brilliant mind in China leading the way, accompanied by an American tycoon and a female French scientist, with "" Japp interjected. ""I know, I know. You can't stop thinking about it. It's becoming an obsession, Monsieur Poirot. Let's change the subject. Are you a fan of chess?"" ""I have dabbled in it, yes."" ""Did you hear about that strange incident yesterday? A match between two renowned players, and one of them passed away during the game?"" ""I heard about it. Dr. Savaronoff, the Russian champion, was one of the players, and the other, who died from heart failure, was the talented young American, Gilmour Wilson.""",1
"I had a feeling of unease regarding Bella. Her infatuation with Jack Renauld was so intense that she would have done anything for him. However, when Jack's behavior towards her changed and he stopped communicating as frequently, Bella became increasingly agitated. She became convinced that he had feelings for another woman, a suspicion that was later proven to be true. Despite my objections, Bella decided to travel to their Villa in Merlinville to confront Jack. Aware of her intentions, she attempted to evade me. Upon discovering that she was not on the train in Calais, I made the decision not to proceed to England without her.",1
"“There’s no time to waste,” declared Tuppence, darting across the street. “I need to detain her. No matter the cost, I must keep her here until…” She paused. “Albert, is there a telephone nearby?” The young boy shook his head. “Most of the apartments have their own phones, miss. But there’s a public booth just around the bend.” “Then go immediately, and call the Ritz Hotel. Ask for Mr. Hersheimmer, and if he’s unavailable, get Sir James and urge them to hurry, as Mrs. Vandemeyer is attempting to flee. If you can’t reach them, contact Sir James Peel Edgerton, his number is listed in the directory, and inform him of the situation.”",1
"The will was not destroyed by John Cavendish. Poirot's intuition proved to be accurate. Without delving into the tedious police court proceedings, it suffices to say that John Cavendish maintained his innocence and was sent for trial. By September, we were all in London with Mary renting a house in Kensington where Poirot joined us. I, on the other hand, had secured a position at the War Office, allowing me to be in regular contact with them. With each passing week, Poirot's anxiety over the missing ""last link"" intensified.",1
"""They no longer pretended to be 'private inquiry agents,' and instead shared the entire backstory of their partnership, which greatly amused the young man. Turning to Tuppence after the tale, he remarked, 'I've always thought English girls were a bit antiquated. Traditional and charming, yes, but afraid to venture out without a servant or elderly relative. I suppose I'm a bit out of touch!' As a result of this newfound trust, Tommy and Tuppence immediately moved into the Ritz, in order to stay close to Jane Finn's sole surviving family member.""",1
"I approached the counter, my voice steady this time. ""Kilmorden Castle?"" I inquired. The attendant informed me that the ship was departing on the 17th from Southampton to Cape Town. ""First or second class?"" he asked. Without hesitation, I asked about the cost. ""First class, eighty-seven pounds,"" he replied. The exact amount of my inheritance! I made up my mind. ""First class,"" I confirmed, sealing my fate. The adventure awaited me. (Excerpts from the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler, M.P.)It's curious how peace always eludes me. I am a man who craves tranquility.",1
"""Flushed cheeks and an unmoved Poirot. A cigarette end and a match, but what does it tell you? Giraud satisfied with South American match. Poirot jokes about thorough searching. South American cigarette end with liquorice pectoral paper. Renauld not the owner. Strangers unprepared but conveniently find weapons. An accomplice theory. Door opened from outside with a key. Suspects include Jack Renauld, the gardener, and Madame Daubreuil. Mysterious visitor, a cheque to ""Duveen,"" and a letter signed ""Bella."" Poirot questions the open door. A crime resembling this one before. The psychology of crime and individual touch. Japp would agree, Hastings.""",1
"“Not the venom of the Borgias,” Poirot responded, a mischievous glint in his eye. “Your mind is racing. I would suggest it was French chalk.” “French chalk?” “Yes, cabinet-makers use it for smooth drawers.” I chuckled. “You mischievous one! I thought you were building up to something thrilling.” “Goodbye, my friend. I retreat. I vanish!” He exited, the door closing behind him. With a half mocking, half fond smile, I picked up the coat and reached for the clothes-brush. The following day, without any word from Poirot, I went for a leisurely walk, ran into some old acquaintances, and had lunch with them at their hotel.",1
"""I have at least five witnesses who can confirm seeing them together, either at six or just after. The Abbey Farm, Mrs. Raikes's residence, is at least two and a half miles away from the village. The alibi is solid,"" Poirot announced confidently. A moment of stunned silence followed. Japp, appearing unsurprised, was the first to speak. ""Well, I'll be damned,"" he exclaimed, ""you've got it! These witnesses of yours, they're reliable, I assume?"" ""Indeed! I have a list of their names and addresses prepared for you to verify. You'll see, they check out,"" Poirot responded with assurance.",1
"""I received an unusual request from him recently,"" Carter said. ""He sent me a newspaper clipping from America. It mentioned a body discovered near the New York docks three weeks ago. He wanted me to gather more details on the case.""  ""I see,"" responded Mr. Smith. ""And did you find anything significant?"" Carter hesitated. ""Not much. The man was around thirty-five years old, poorly dressed, with a severely disfigured face. His identity remains unknown."" ""Do you believe there is a connection between this case and our current situation?"" Mr. Smith inquired. Carter nodded. ""I have a suspicion. But I could be mistaken.""",1
"""I followed their tracks to the kitchen, but no further. First key detail. There was a faint blood smear on the door lintel of Robert Grant. Key detail number two. The third key detail emerged when I compared Grant's boots to the footprints. Case closed. It was an inside job. I apprehended Grant, only to discover in his luggage the jade figures and a ticket-of-leave. Turns out Robert Grant was none other than Abraham Biggs, a notorious criminal convicted of burglary and felony five years prior.""",1
"Japp and Poirot discussed quietly as they made their way upstairs. It was Japp who decided that everyone, except the servants, should gather in the drawing-room. I understood the implications of this request. Poirot needed to back up his claims. Personally, I had my doubts. While Poirot may have had his reasons to believe in Inglethorp's innocence, someone like Summerhaye would need solid evidence, which I wasn't sure Poirot could provide. Soon enough, we all entered the drawing-room, with Japp shutting the door behind us.",1
"Tommy carefully watched as the paper curled under the heat, revealing a message in brown printing: WITH THE COMPLIMENTS OF MR. BROWN. The shock of Mr. Brown's preemptive move left them speechless. Julius couldn't comprehend how they were outsmarted. Tommy, resigned to defeat, noted the significance of the new stitches.",1
"""He grabbed his small briefcase and we exited through the wide window in the living room. Cynthia Murdoch was entering just as we left, and Poirot stepped aside to allow her to pass. “Excuse me, miss, just a moment.” “Yes?” she asked, looking puzzled. “Have you ever prepared Mrs. Inglethorp’s medications?” A faint blush appeared on her cheeks as she replied a bit stiffly: “No.” “Only her powders?” The blush intensified as Cynthia responded: “Oh, yes, I did prepare some sleeping powders for her once.” “These?” Poirot presented the now-empty box that had held the powders. She confirmed. “Can you tell me what they were? Sulphonal? Veronal?” “No, they were bromide powders.”",1
"""And my marriage isn't as stable as I thought,"" Suzanne said sadly. ""Clarence has been sending urgent messages for me to return home, but I've ignored them for weeks now."" I couldn't bring myself to be too concerned about Suzanne's marital issues. She had a way of handling Clarence when necessary. Changing the topic, I brought up the matter of the missing diamonds. Suzanne's eyes widened in shock. ""Let me clarify, Anne. When I started suspecting Colonel Race, I became very anxious about the diamonds.""",1
"“What do you suggest we do with this pile of rubbish? Toss it into the river?” he inquired nonchalantly. “If that’s your preference,” I replied calmly. “I must say, Miss Beddingfeld, I do appreciate your unabashed, ruthless instincts. But we shall allow him to recuperate at his own pace. His injuries are not severe.” “You appear to balk at the idea of a second murder,” I remarked sweetly. “A second murder?” He appeared genuinely confused. “The woman in Marlow,” I reminded him, studying his reaction intently. A dark, brooding look clouded his face. It was as though he had forgotten I was there. “I may have been responsible for her death,” he confessed. “At times, I wonder if I had intended to harm her.",1
"""But Sir, he was as dark as a thundercloud all day! Couldn't please him at all!"" The noise of a door closing upstairs interrupted Léonie's chatter.

""They went to check the car in the garage. The commissioner thought it might have been used on the night of the murder."" ""What an idea,"" Poirot muttered, watching the girl vanish. ""Will you go out and join them?"" ""No, I'll wait for them in the lounge. It's cooler there on this hot morning.""",1
"""A sudden fear gripped him as he considered the possibility that this could be one of those cruel tactics used to extract information, a method often linked to Boris. However, he quickly pushed aside that thought. ""It must be that unpleasant Conrad,"" he concluded. ""I look forward to settling the score with him. This is simply a petty act of revenge on his part. I'm sure of it."" As he pondered further, a desire grew within him to strike something hard against Conrad's round head.""",1
"When the petite man had completed his business with me, he joined his companion, and together they compelled my husband to stand and go with them into the adjacent dressing-room. Despite my overwhelming fear, I strained to listen intently. Their voices were hushed, preventing me from catching their words. However, the dialect was familiar, a corrupted form of Spanish heard in select regions of South America. It was evident that they were pressuring my husband for something, as their agitation escalated with raised voices. The taller man appeared to take the lead. 'You are aware of our demands!' he exclaimed.",1
"I'll find the scoundrel and clear my name, or die trying. He tried to murder you cleverly, but I saw through his plan. Let me tell you the whole story, from the beginning. My real name is Harry Lucas and my father was a soldier in Rhodesia. Fate brought me to Young Eardsley, and together we found diamonds in British Guiana. Anita Grünberg came between us, a mystery we fell for. She betrayed us, and we lost everything. Now, I will seek justice for us both.",1

It's quite exhausting."" ""You sly old dog,"" I chuckled. ""You never reveal your hand.""",1
"""At first, the situation appeared completely implausible. Mr. Hersheimmer, the son of a wealthy millionaire, was a well-known individual in America. The idea that he and Mr. Brown were one and the same seemed completely far-fetched. However, one cannot ignore the evidence. Given the circumstances, it had to be acknowledged. Consider Mrs. Vandemeyer's sudden and unexplained distress. It served as further confirmation. ""I subtly hinted at it early on. Based on some remarks made by Mr. Hersheimmer in Manchester, I inferred that you had grasped the hint and taken action. That's when I began working to demonstrate the seemingly impossible as possible.",1
"John Cavendish stood waiting on the platform, guiding me towards the car. He mentioned having a bit of petrol left, thanks to his mother. Styles St. Mary village was located roughly two miles from the station, with Styles Court just a mile beyond. The quiet, warm day in July painted the Essex countryside in a peaceful light under the afternoon sun. Despite the tranquility, the looming presence of war was a stark reminder that a different reality existed not too far away. It felt as though I had entered a completely different realm.",1
"I placed an ad in several morning newspapers, then sat in a Soho restaurant to assess its impact. Suddenly, a paragraph in the paper caught my attention. It detailed the sudden disappearance of Mr. John Ingles from the S.S. Shanghai after departing Marseilles. Despite calm weather, it was suspected that he had fallen overboard. The article concluded with a mention of Mr. Ingles's extensive and esteemed work in China.",1
"The woman in charge of his meals, Betsy Andrews, confided in us about the disappearance of her employer's prized collection of Chinese jade figurines. Initially, it appeared to be a clear case of theft and violence, yet the circumstances proved to be far more complex. The elderly man had only two individuals in his employ; Betsy Andrews, a local from Hoppaton, and a rugged male attendant named Robert Grant. Grant had left the premises to collect milk as part of his daily routine, while Betsy had briefly stepped out to converse with a neighbor. The window of opportunity for the crime was a mere twenty minutes, between ten and half-past, during which Betsy was absent. Interestingly, Grant was the first to return to the residence.",1
"""Guess what? I'll clear my name or die trying. The scoundrel who tried to murder you will pay,"" he vowed. ""He didn't push you, but he deceived you. Stones on the path were moved, luring you to step into nothingness. I'll find him,"" he promised. Then, in a different tone, he opened up about his past. ""My real name is Harry Lucas,"" he confessed. Raised in Rhodesia, he met Eardsley at Cambridge, bonding over a love for South Africa. Together, they found diamonds in British Guiana, but Anita Grünberg's betrayal led to their downfall. The police seized the diamonds, and Eardsley's influence couldn't save them.""",1
"""But were it not for the firm grip of the second man, I would surely have plummeted into the gaping chasm below. The darkness was all-encompassing, the sound of water roaring below filled the air. ""Consider carefully,"" urged the man on the divan. ""Captain Hastings, if you persist in your refusal, you will find yourself meeting your demise in the depths of those dark waters. This is your final opportunity - will you pen that letter?"" I do not possess extraordinary courage. I must confess, I was absolutely terrified, consumed by fear. The sinister intentions of that Chinese man were unmistakable.""",1
"I was taken aback when our previously unresponsive patient suddenly sat up and uttered, ""Li Chang Yen."" His demeanor was that of someone abruptly jolted awake. Poirot gestured for me to stay silent as the man continued, speaking with a precise and authoritative tone. It seemed as if he was reciting from a formal document or presentation. ""Li Chang Yen is the mastermind behind the Big Four, the driving force. I have identified him as Number One. Number Two remains elusive, rarely spoken of by name.",1
"Man is a creature of habit. Habitual in his lawful routines, just as predictable in his unlawful activities. When a man breaks the law, his subsequent transgressions tend to mirror the original offense. Take for instance the notorious English killer who eliminated his spouses one after the other by drowning them in their own tubs. If he had only diversified his tactics, perhaps he could have evaded capture indefinitely. However, he fell victim to the conventional patterns of human behavior, convinced that past methods would guarantee future success. And so, he ultimately suffered the consequences of his unimaginative approach.",1
"A Chinese man, an American, a French woman, and another individual. Let us hope we return in time, Hastings."" ""Do you believe our visitor is in danger?"" ""I am certain of it."" Upon our arrival, Mrs. Pearson welcomed us. Disregarding her amazement upon seeing Poirot, we inquired about any news. The response was comforting. No one had visited, and our guest had not indicated anything. With a sense of relief, we proceeded to the rooms. Poirot entered the outer room and proceeded to the inner chamber. Suddenly, he called out to me, his voice filled with agitation. ""Hastings, he has passed away."" I hurried over to him. The man was in the same position as before, but lifeless, and had been so for a while. I dashed out to find a doctor.",1
"I pondered whether the killer had left any footprints the day before. The authorities would probably not divulge this information, but I doubted it. The climate had been pleasant and arid. The space itself was unremarkable. A nearly square shape with two large bay windows, simple white walls, and a bare wooden floor, the perimeter of which was marked by the absence of a carpet. I meticulously examined the area, yet there was not even a single object left behind. The brilliant young investigator appeared unlikely to stumble upon an overlooked piece of evidence.",1
"""And never bothered with a polite farewell to the ladies. Hey Jane, you can hop onto the seat now."" The girl finally spoke. ""How did you manage to 'convince' him?"" she inquired. Julius pointed to his gun. ""Little Willie gets the credit for that!"" ""Fantastic!"" the girl exclaimed. A flush of color spread across her face, her eyes gazing admirably at Julius. ""Annette and I were clueless about our fate,"" Tuppence admitted. ""Old Whittington rushed us away. We thought it was like leading lambs to the slaughter."" ""Annette,"" Julius echoed. ""Is that what you call her?"" His thoughts appeared to be grappling with a new concept.",1
"It was well past midnight when we finally reached Elmstead, the imposing residence that loomed before us. Nurse Palmer had been sent ahead, ensuring that our arrival would be staggered. Mrs. Templeton, a striking woman with an air of mystery, greeted us upon entry. Upon hearing Poirot reveal his occupation, she visibly tensed, though she managed to maintain her composure throughout his inquiry regarding the maid-servant. Poirot then delved into a detailed account of a past poisoning case, closely observing Mrs. Templeton's every reaction. Despite her best efforts, her growing unease was impossible to conceal.",1
"“I don’t see it either. Let me tell you, my friend, it’s quite a mystery. Hercule Poirot speaking!” “But if you think he’s innocent, how do you explain his purchase of the poison?” “It’s quite simple. He didn’t make the purchase.” “But Mace identified him!” “I must correct you, he saw a man with a dark beard similar to Mr. Inglethorp’s, wearing glasses like Mr. Inglethorp, and dressed in Mr. Inglethorp’s distinctive attire. He couldn’t have identified a man he had likely only glimpsed from afar, given that he himself had only been in the village for two weeks, and Mrs. Inglethorp mainly shopped at Coot’s in Tadminster.”",1
"Just as they approached the Bond Street Tube station, Tommy discreetly followed them across the road and into the bustling Lyons'. Finding a table on the first floor near the window, they settled down as the late hour caused the crowd to disperse. Tommy strategically positioned himself at the table adjacent to theirs, keeping a close eye on Whittington while also observing the second man intently. With a fair complexion and a disagreeable visage, Tommy suspected he was of Russian or Polish descent.",1
"We had planned to attend the Sunday concert, followed by an afternoon out, and then a nap after a hearty dinner of England le rosbif. These activities were meant to divert attention from Hercule Poirot's investigations. As we entered the crude wooden contraption, I hesitated. ""Are we breaking into the flat?"" I inquired cautiously. Poirot's response did little to ease my concerns: ""Not today,"" he said cryptically. With a tug on the rope, we descended to the second floor.",1
"It was the small recess immediately on his right that captured his attention in the room he had been instructed to enter. Half hidden by a torn velvet curtain, it offered a perfect vantage point, directly facing the left-handed door and providing a clear view of the upper staircase. With dimensions of about two feet in depth and three feet in width, it could easily conceal one, or at a push, two individuals. Tommy found himself drawn to it, his mind working methodically as he considered the significance of the mention of ""Mr. Brown."" It dawned on him that it was likely a secret code, a password used by the criminal organization. His successful use of it had granted him entry.",1
"“Could she be hiding somewhere else?” “No, sir. I have to leave now, they are expecting me.” She quickly exited. The lock clicked shut. “I wonder who ‘they’ could be,” pondered Tommy, while nibbling on the bread. “Maybe that girl could assist me in escaping. She doesn’t seem to be part of the gang.” An hour later, Annette returned with a tray, this time with Conrad by her side. “Hello,” greeted Tommy cheerfully. “Looks like you missed out on Pear’s soap.” Conrad snarled in response.",1
"“We gratefully accepted her offer of something to eat, hoping our presence might distract her from her grief. Just as we finished our soup, a scream and the sound of breaking crockery startled us. The parlourmaid rushed in, her hand clutching her heart. “There was a man in the passage,” she gasped. Poirot quickly investigated, but found no one there. “Are you sure?” the maid whispered weakly. “It truly gave me a fright!” “But why?” Poirot inquired, lowering his voice.",1
"""Some young whipper-snapper in Durban, I suppose, who puts my mature charms completely in the shade. By the way, Pagett’s going down in the car in a minute or two. He could take you to the station."" ""Oh, no, thank you,"" I said hastily. ""Mrs. Blair and I have got our own taxi ordered."" To go down with Guy Pagett was the last thing I wanted! Sir Eustace looked at me attentively. ""I don’t believe you like Pagett. I don’t blame you. Of all the officious, interfering asses going about with the air of a martyr, and doing everything he can to annoy and upset me!"" ""What has he done now?"" I inquired with some curiosity. ""He’s got hold of a secretary for me.",1
"She hopped onto the train at the very last moment, gasping for breath as if she had just finished a marathon, yet Pagett claimed he saw her boarding a train to Durban the previous night! Either Pagett was intoxicated once again or the girl must have a supernatural presence. And she never offers any explanation. No one ever does. Ah, the ""Secretaries I have encountered."" The first, a fugitive murderer on the run. The second, a hidden drinker involved in scandalous affairs in Italy. The third, a stunning woman with the uncanny ability to be in two places simultaneously.",1
"""My father passed away when I was just six years old. A few years later, my mother also left this world. The only family I had left was my Uncle Andrew, who had returned from Australia and bought Crabtree Manor, a small farmhouse, in his home county. Despite his kind treatment of me, he had very traditional views on the upbringing of women, valuing practical skills over book knowledge. I, however, rebelled against his wishes, determined to pursue my education. When my uncle passed away, his will revealed a challenge for me - to prove my intelligence within a year to inherit his fortune. I enlisted the help of Hercule Poirot to solve this puzzle, believing it to be a test of wits left by my uncle.""",1
"[Illustration] Poirot carefully locked the door behind him before embarking on a thorough examination of the room. With the swiftness of a grasshopper, he moved from one item to the next. Meanwhile, I stood near the door, hesitant to disturb any potential evidence. Poirot, however, showed no appreciation for my caution. ""What are you doing over there, my friend?"" he exclaimed. ""You look like a stuck pig!"" I mentioned my concern about destroying any footprints. Poirot scoffed, ""Footprints? Absurd! There have been countless people in this room already. Come, help me search instead.""",1
"“Dorcas, my dear, a thought has struck me, a small thought that could lead to something grand! Can you recall, on the day before the tragedy, not Tuesday but Monday, if anything peculiar happened with Mrs. Inglethorp’s bell?” Dorcas appeared taken aback. “Indeed, sir, now that you mention it, there was a glitch; although I am unsure as to how you knew. It seems that a mouse, or some other creature, may have chewed through the wire. The repairman came and fixed it on Tuesday morning.” With a delighted sigh, Poirot gestured towards the morning-room. “You see, sometimes we need not seek external evidence, for logic alone should suffice.",1
"""Youth calls to youth, but my work still beckons,"" I said quietly. It felt impossible to love two men simultaneously, yet the allure of this man was undeniable. Looking into his eyes, I whispered, ""Your future is destined for greatness. You will leave a mark on the world."" It was as if I was foreseeing his path. ""I will be alone,"" he mused. ""That's the price of greatness,"" I assured him. With a gentle grasp of my hand, he confessed, ""I wish it was the other way."" Just then, Harry appeared from around the house, interrupting our moment.",1
"The message read: “The sacred diamond, the god's eye, must be returned to its origin.” The next letter repeated the same demand, while the third one was direct: “You have defied the warning. Now, the diamond will be taken from you. When the full moon shines, both diamonds will reunite. It is fate.” Miss Marvell recounted, “I dismissed the initial note as a prank. The second one gave me pause. The third, received yesterday, left me uneasy. The situation is graver than I anticipated.”",1
"He was a villain indeed, but his charm was undeniable. I kept my true feelings hidden, aware that Colonel Race had a different perspective. Despite the escape being expected, I doubted they would catch him. I maintained a lukewarm response, and the conversation faltered until Colonel Race inquired about Harry. I informed him of Harry's absence and his clearance of suspicion. Then, Colonel Race dropped a bombshell, revealing Harry's true identity as John Harold Eardsley. My mind raced, questioning everything Harry had told me. His deception was finally exposed, leaving me torn between forgiveness and betrayal.",1
"""He wasn't much to look at,"" Flossie Monro said dreamily, with a wag of her finger. ""Me and Claudie, two young things, what else could you expect? I still have a kindly feeling for him, even though he didn't treat me well at all. Not as a lady should be treated. When it comes to a question of money, they're all the same."" Poirot protested, refilling her glass, ""No, no, mademoiselle, do not say that. Could you describe Mr. Darrell to me?""",1
"""He appeared deep in thought, his forehead furrowed in concentration. It was clear that his sharp mind was finally kicking into gear. The anticipation grew as we waited for him to speak. Suddenly, breaking the silence, he turned to Japp and inquired, 'Do you happen to know if Mr. and Mrs. Davenheim shared a bedroom?' The question caught us off guard, leaving us momentarily speechless. Japp couldn't help but burst into laughter. 'Oh Monsieur Poirot, I was expecting something much more dramatic!'""",1
"""The Government would finally be completely broken."" ""What more do you desire?"" ""The document itself,"" the German stated bluntly. ""You do not possess it? Do you know its whereabouts?"" ""No."" ""Does anyone know where it is?"" ""Possibly one person. But even that is uncertain."" ""Who is this individual?"" ""A girl."" Tommy's heart raced. ""A girl?"" The Russian's tone turned scornful. ""And you have not extracted the information from her? In Russia, we have methods to make a girl talk."" ""This situation is unique,"" the German replied sulkily. ""How so?"" After a brief pause, he continued: ""Where is the girl now?"" ""The girl?"" ""Yes."" ""She is..."" But Tommy caught no more.",1
"She leaned forward, her hand opening to reveal a stone of white fire set in platinum. Poirot marveled at its flawlessness. Miss Marvell explained that they were going to Yardly Chase, where a film deal was in the works with Lord Yardly. Lady Yardly arrived, revealing that she too had received mysterious letters about her diamond. Poirot decided to intervene by contacting Lord Yardly. Lord Yardly confessed his financial troubles and his plan to sell the Star of the East. Lady Yardly disagreed with his decision.",1
"Was this the dreadful truth they had hinted at? Evelyn's disbelief now seemed naive. The pieces fit together seamlessly. Miss Howard's advice to keep quiet finally made sense. The unfinished sentence echoed in my mind: ""Emily herself..."" I couldn't help but agree. Mrs. Inglethorp would have chosen dishonor over revenge to spare the Cavendish name. John's interruption caught me off guard, casting doubt on everything I thought I knew.",1
"""I have my suspicions about Guy Pagett and his time in Florence,"" said Sir Eustace, watching his secretary's hasty departure. ""Every time Italy comes up, he's out the door before you can blink."" ""Maybe he's got a murder or two under his belt from his days there,"" Mrs. Blair chimed in optimistically. ""I hate to say it, Sir Eustace, but he does have that look about him."" ""Oh, definitely a classic Cinquecento villain! It's quite amusing really, especially knowing how law-abiding and decent he actually is,"" Sir Eustace replied. ""He's been by your side for quite a while now, hasn't he, Sir Eustace?"" Colonel Race inquired.",1
"I will search every corner of the city until I find him, and once I do, I will make him mine. I would do anything for him. I would toil for him, serve him, commit crimes for him, and even plead or steal for him if necessary! Now you understand!"" Sarah stared at me intently. ""You are not like the typical English woman, Gipsy girl,"" she remarked eventually. ""You possess a unique combination of practicality and intense emotion. I doubt I will ever feel that way about anyone, thankfully for me, but at the same time, I cannot help but envy you, Gipsy girl. It is a rare gift to truly care for someone. Most individuals are incapable of such depth of feeling.""",1
"A while back, a group of criminals and shooters were rounded up, along with some documents that shed new light on the situation. These papers mentioned a group known as the 'Big Four' and described a sophisticated wireless system with unprecedented capabilities, including the ability to focus intense energy on specific targets. Despite the seemingly outrageous claims, I handed the papers over to headquarters, where a knowledgeable professor took on the task of deciphering them.",1
"As Micky made his entrance, his round face and perpetually surprised eyebrows caught everyone's attention. The awkward grin he offered while shaking hands hinted at his true nature. Once we gathered for dinner, Dr. Treves excused himself to fetch wine, leaving Micky to reveal a sudden shift in demeanor. With a piercing gaze, he turned to Poirot and cryptically mentioned his father, claiming knowledge that others underestimated.",1
"""Clearly, my dear friend had just discovered she'd been deceived!"" the woman insisted. ""The letter doesn't explicitly say that,"" the Coroner countered. ""Emily never admitted fault. She wanted me to return, but wouldn't admit I was right. That's just how she was. I don't believe in such games."" Mr. Wells smirked, as did some of the jury members. Miss Howard was clearly a well-known figure. ""This charade is a waste of time,"" she added, eyeing the jury with disdain.",1
"“What difference does the method make? Whether it was arsenic or strychnine, the end result would be the same for poor Emily. My conviction lies in the fact that he is guilty, regardless of the means.” Poirot spoke calmly. “Let me rephrase my query. Did you ever truly believe that Mrs. Inglethorp met her end at the hands of her husband?” Miss Howard exclaimed, “Of course! I have always maintained that he is a despicable man. I have always feared he would carry out the ultimate betrayal. I have always despised him with a passion.” Poirot nodded. “Precisely. This confirms my theory entirely.”",1
"He observed the gathering closely, analyzing each person's actions before deciding to join in. A mysterious figure, with a stealthy and silent approach, ascended the stairs, catching Tommy off guard. Tommy was taken aback by the man's menacing appearance, a clear reflection of the criminal underworld. The man's sinister features and brutish demeanor were unfamiliar to Tommy, but unmistakable to any seasoned detective. As the man passed by, his heavy breathing sending shivers down Tommy's spine, he paused at a nearby door and rapped out a secret code.",1
"Poirot's face showed confusion as he watched the man leave the room. ""The Big Four triumph once more,"" he muttered. Turning to me, he asked, ""What is that in your hand, Hastings?"" I passed it to him. ""The countess left this note behind,"" I informed him. After reading it, he remarked, ""Goodbye. I.V."" ""Her initials are I.V. It's interesting that they could also mean Four. I can't help but wonder, Hastings, I can't help but wonder.""",1
"""Don't fear me, Bella. Please, don't fear me. I do love you, that's the truth, but I don't expect anything in return. Just allow me to assist you. If you must, continue to love him, but let me be there for you in ways he cannot."" Her reaction was as if she had been petrified by my words. Looking up from her hands, she gazed at me. ""You really believe that?"" she murmured. ""You truly believe that I care for Jack Renauld?"" Then, with a mixture of laughter and tears, she embraced me tightly, burying her face against mine. ""Not in the way I love you,"" she whispered.",1
"Quentin gives Mr. Paynter a fatal dose of yellow jasmine, not strychnine as he claims. After administering the poison, Quentin leaves through the open window. Later that night, he sneaks back in through the window, locates the manuscript, and throws Mr. Paynter into the flames. Ignoring the newspaper that falls to the ground and is hidden by the victim's body, Quentin frames the Big Four for the murder. To cover his tracks, Quentin spikes the curry with powdered opium before sending it off for testing.",1
"Cinderella was standing in the doorway, her breath coming in little gasps. She asked me why I was in Coventry and if the man with me was a detective. As she spoke, her stage dress cloak slipped from her shoulders, revealing her fear. I reassured her, holding her close as she wept bitterly. It was she who took the dagger, afraid of leaving fingerprints. I promised not to give her up to the police, confessing my love for her. She was shocked, asking what I knew. I recounted her visit to Mr. Renauld and the torn cheque.",1
"Mrs. Renauld descended the stairs, supported by Léonie, her head bandaged. The French girl pleaded with her to return to bed, fearing for her well-being. Mrs. Renauld, however, pushed forward, disowning Jack and accusing him of his father's death. Jack, shocked and confused, was helped to the Villa Marguerite where he was attended to by a doctor. Poirot and I, hungry and tired, secured rooms at the Hôtel des Bains for the night. There, we met Miss Robinson, who had a mysterious task for Poirot. Despite her insistence on joining us, we set out on a night mission to the Villa Geneviève. On our way back, we checked on Jack's condition at the Villa Marguerite, where we encountered Madame Daubreuil and observed Jack's troubled sleep.",1
"""I suspect she's related to the hall porter, or someone similar. And no one suspects that I have any ties to our mutual acquaintance, Mr. Brown."" ""Please, Rita, watch out. That door is open."" ""Well, close it then,"" the woman chuckled. Tuppence quickly left. She couldn't stay away from the rear of the house for too long, but she cleaned and tidied up with the swiftness she had learned in the hospital. Afterwards, she quietly returned to the boudoir door. The cook, moving at a slower pace, was still working in the kitchen and, if she noticed Tuppence's absence, would assume she was making the beds.",1
"""The films that disappeared through the vent on the 22nd, remember? How do you know they were the originals? Who would go through the trouble of returning them that way in the dead of night? It doesn't make sense. They were a warning, the films had been swapped out of the yellow tin case, replaced with something else. Do you still have it?"" ""I might have used it. Wait, found it. I think I left it on the shelf by the bed."" She handed it over. Just a regular round tin, like the ones used for tropical films.""",1
"""She works as a lady's maid, if I remember correctly, so she probably won't be there, and, besides, she's not likely to show up."" ""In that case, the Mayfair woman is the obvious first choice."" ""Tommy, I'm feeling disheartened."" ""Cheer up, old friend. We always knew it was a long shot. And, anyway, we're just getting started. If we don't find anything in London, there's a great journey through England, Ireland, and Scotland ahead of us."" ""That's true,"" Tuppence replied, feeling her spirits lift. ""And all expenses covered! But, oh, Tommy, I do prefer things to move quickly.""",1
"Tommy trailed him discreetly from a distance. Eventually, they arrived at a small rundown square. Amidst the grime and decay, the houses exuded a menacing vibe. Boris surveyed the area, prompting Tommy to retreat to the safety of a nearby porch. The square appeared deserted, tucked away from any through traffic. Tommy's curiosity was piqued by the furtive glances of the other man. Peering from the doorway, he observed as the man ascended the steps of a particularly ominous house and knocked on the door with a distinct, rhythmic pattern. The door swung open without delay, allowing the man to exchange a few words with the doorkeeper before disappearing inside.",1
"""Clearly, her husband was the culprit in her poisoning. I had always suspected he would be the one to do her in. And now, here we are. Yet all you offer are feeble excuses about 'heart failure' and 'inquest scheduled for Friday.' John Cavendish, you should be utterly ashamed of yourself.""  ""What exactly do you propose I do?"" John inquired, a slight grin tugging at his lips. ""Come now, Evie, it's not like I can simply drag him to the nearest police station.""  ""Well, you must take some action. Uncover his methods. He's a sly one, that man. Perhaps he used poisoned fly papers.""",1
"""Imagine this scenario: he wakes up and catches a glimpse of me vanishing into the distance. Wouldn't he automatically assume that I was the one who attacked him? Especially since he already suspected me of following him?” “It’s a possibility,” I responded thoughtfully. “But it changes our entire perspective. And there are other factors to consider.” “Most of them have logical explanations. The individual who trailed you in Cape Town interacted with Pagett, who then checked his watch. Perhaps the man simply wanted to know the time.” “So, it was just a random occurrence?” “Not quite. There seems to be a calculated strategy at play here, linking Pagett to the whole incident.""",1
"""He's off making his preparations,"" Poirot announced calmly. ""Why don't we enjoy our coffee outside on the terrace, my dear friend? It seems more pleasant. I'll just grab a coat."" I stepped onto the terrace, feeling a bit uneasy. Poirot's confidence didn't entirely reassure me. Nevertheless, as long as we stayed vigilant, we'd be safe. I made a mental note to remain on high alert. Poirot finally joined me after five minutes. Bundled up to his ears as usual to ward off the cold, he settled down next to me and savored his coffee.",1
"Poirot surveyed the room, a look of concern etched on his face. ""I can't find the light,"" he whispered. ""I glimpsed it momentarily, but now everything is shrouded in darkness once more. The motive eludes me.""   Japp interjected, his tone grim. ""Young Gerald Paynter had a rather compelling motive,"" he stated. ""He has a history of recklessness and extravagance. Artists, you know, often lack morals entirely.""  Poirot dismissed Japp's criticism of artists with a smile. ""My dear Japp, are you trying to mislead me? I am well aware that your suspicions lie with the Chinaman.""",1
"But it would have been suicide, mon ami! The plan was well laid out. The chloroform to subdue, the morphine to finish. Madame Renauld was the target, but she fought back. Marthe Daubreuil had to improvise. No suicide, but a desperate attempt to escape. The truth came out, not by Poirot's hand, but by a young acrobat. I pondered, when did suspicion first arise? The answer was clear. Marthe's anxious eyes gave her away. She had a motive, a plan, but it all unraveled. Jack Renauld recovered, but Madame Daubreuil vanished. Secrets buried, truths revealed. Jack's future uncertain, but love may prevail. As for me, a new beginning awaits, far from the crimes of the past.",1
"""Is there a problem with the ship?"" ""You probably have a better idea of what's going on than I do,"" he responded curtly. ""Orders from the Admiralty. A destroyer is waiting to transfer you off."" ""What?"" I exclaimed. ""Out in the middle of the ocean?"" ""It's a highly unusual situation, but it's not my concern. They've sent a young man to replace you, and we are all under strict confidentiality. Can you please get dressed and come with me?"" Completely shocked, I followed his instructions. A small boat was lowered, and I was taken onto the destroyer.",1
"‘Doc, let’s cut to the chase,’ I said. ‘Have you ever come across a young woman by the name of Jane Finn?’ The doctor pondered for a moment. ‘Jane Finn?’ he repeated. ‘No.’ Disappointed, I couldn’t hide my frustration. ‘Are you absolutely certain?’ ‘Positive, Mr. Hersheimmer. It’s a rather unusual name, I would remember.’ I was deflated. I had hoped this would be the breakthrough I needed. ‘Well, that’s that,’ I sighed. ‘But there’s something else. While I was hanging onto that branch for dear life, I thought I saw a familiar face chatting with one of your nurses.’",1
"They had obtained the oilskin packet filled with blanks, and their anger was palpable! The uncertainty regarding whether I had altered the documents or if Danvers had deceptively carried a false message lingered. The thought of being tortured for information haunted me. I experienced a level of fear I had never known before. At one point, they even approached me. I kept my eyes closed, feigning unconsciousness, terrified that they would hear the pounding of my heart. Luckily, they eventually departed. In that moment, my mind raced uncontrollably.",1
"“There comes a point where a man is given the opportunity to hang himself, Sir Eustace.” “Indeed, indeed.” “The strikers are not the root of the issue. They are being orchestrated by an unknown entity. Weapons and bombs have been flooding in, and we have uncovered crucial documents that reveal the strategies used to bring them in. There is a specific code. Potatoes signify ‘detonators,’ cauliflower represents ‘rifles,’ while other produce indicates different types of explosives.” “Fascinating,” I remarked.",1
"I gasped in shock as I saw her standing there, a suppressed shriek escaping her lips. It was Cinderella, my friend from the train. The surprise was mutual as we both exclaimed in unison. ""You!"" she cried, her eyes wide. ""My only Aunt!"" I replied, taken aback. ""What are you doing here?"" The conversation quickly turned playful as we bantered back and forth, reminiscing on past encounters. Cinderella's mischievous smile never faded as she revealed her love for crimes and mysteries. I couldn't help but be intrigued by her eagerness to explore the crime scene at the Villa Geneviève. Despite my reluctance, she insisted on tagging along, eager to see all the details of the investigation.",1
"I have informed Mr. Blair that he needs to handle some rare and valuable curios in Cape Town. Miss Pettigrew and I are leaving for an adventure together. The situation in Johannesburg is tense, with strikers causing chaos in the streets. I met Reeves, who is now retracting his inflammatory speeches. The Government suspects a secret organization behind the unrest. A Government official hinted at trouble and offered to send me to Pretoria. Anne is safe in Kimberley, much to my relief. Race and I discussed Anne's mysterious disappearance. Suzanne expressed concerns about her marriage. The conversation then turned to the diamonds.",1
"""My sole focus was to escape before he was discovered,"" he said.   ""And the jade statues?"" The man paused. ""You see...""   ""So, you stole them on impulse after learning of their value from your employer? I see. Now, tell me. Did you take the statues the first time you entered the room?""   ""I only went in once. That was enough for me.""   ""You're positive?""   ""Absolutely.""   ""Alright. When were you released from prison?""   ""Two months back.""   ""And how did you land this job?""   ""Thanks to a program for ex-convicts.""",1
"It struck Tuppence as peculiar how reliable and level-headed Tommy appeared, providing a sense of direction she sorely lacked in his absence. Surprisingly, despite Julius's superior intellect, he failed to instill the same sense of assurance in her. Tuppence had often criticized Tommy for his pessimism, yet she found herself depending heavily on his judgment, despite his cautious nature. The gravity of their once carefree mission now dawned on her for the first time, casting a shadow over their endeavors.",1
"""Yet the fearless shop owner adamantly rejected their demand. Enraged by his defiance, one of the individuals promptly plunged a knife into his chest. Utilizing the victim's keys, they unlocked the secure compartment tucked away in the room, snatching a multitude of documents. Both suspects sported thick beards and concealed their identities behind masks, although Madame Beroldy confidently identified them as Russians. The incident sparked widespread shock and intrigue, earning labels such as ""the Nihilist Tragedy,"" ""Insurgents of Paris,"" and the ""Enigma from the East.""",1
"She might gain insights from the cook. Nothing occurred and, after a brief pause, Tuppence rang the bell once more, holding it down for a few moments. Eventually, she heard approaching footsteps, and shortly after Mrs. Vandemeyer appeared at the door. She raised an eyebrow upon seeing the girl. “You?” “I was experiencing some tooth discomfort, ma’am,” Tuppence explained smoothly. “I thought it best to return home and have a peaceful evening.” Mrs. Vandemeyer remained silent, but she stepped aside to allow Tuppence to enter the hallway.",1
"""Very well,"" I said weakly. ""You won't mention to anyone that I'm coming with you."" ""Very well,"" I repeated. It may be better to have this guy with me, but I had a feeling that I was headed into trouble. Just when I thought I had found peace! I stopped him as he was leaving. ""I should probably know the name of my new secretary,"" I remarked sarcastically. He thought for a moment. ""Harry Rayburn sounds like a good name,"" he said. It was an odd way of putting it. ""Very well,"" I said for the third time.",1
"I never suspected the extent of my own foolishness. I foolishly believed I had ample time before her arrival at the Villa. Mademoiselle Marthe was certainly cunning.” “Her goal was to kill Mrs. Renauld?” “Indeed. By doing so, the entire inheritance would go to her son. But it would have been a reckless move, my friend! Beside Marthe Daubreuil's lifeless body, I discovered a pad, a small bottle of chloroform, and a syringe filled with a lethal dose of morphine. Do you see? First the chloroform, then, once the victim is unconscious, the needle's prick.",1
"“Ah, I see you're already familiar with the recent events,” remarked the detective, his expression unchanged. “I am always well-informed,” replied the inspector calmly. “But there is one detail that has likely escaped your notice,” interjected the officer, eager to display his expertise. He proceeded to recount the peculiar encounter with the unknown individual the previous evening, mentioning the peculiar check made out to ""Duveen"" and concluding with the letter signed ""Bella."" The detective listened attentively, examined the letter meticulously, and returned it without a word. “Fascinating, Monsieur. However, my original hypothesis remains unaltered.""",1
"""He guided me through the hall, opening a door at the rear and gesturing for me to enter. Sunlight flooded the room, momentarily blinding me before I could make out a familiar figure standing before me. It seemed unbelievable, yet there he was - Poirot! I couldn't help but exclaim his name and allowed myself to be enveloped in his embrace. ""Yes, it is I, Hercule Poirot, not so easily defeated,"" he declared. ""But why the deception?"" I asked. ""A strategic maneuver, my friend, all part of our master plan,"" he replied, a sly smile playing on his lips.",1
"I retrieved the keys and made my way to the Mill House, satisfied with my reconstructions thus far. The discrepancies between the man described by Mrs. James and my Tube ""doctor"" were merely superficial. An overcoat, a beard, gold-rimmed eyeglasses. Although the ""doctor"" seemed middle-aged, his movements hinted at youthfulness. The victim of the accident (whom I dubbed the Moth Ball man) and the foreign woman, Mrs. James, were the focus of my investigation.",1
"The bait was the draft treaty Tommy used. At times, he was shocked by his audacity. How could he believe he found what many others missed? Still, he held fast to his theory. That night, he and Albert snuck into the grounds of Astley Priors again. Tommy's goal was to somehow enter the house. As they neared, Tommy suddenly gasped. A figure on the second floor cast a shadow on the blind, standing between the window and the light.",1
"When he dared to challenge Fate, he proved to be a skilled player. He could face defeat with a grin. ""Regardless,"" he remarked casually, ""I doubt our paths will cross again."" ""No,"" I responded slowly. ""I don't think so."" ""Farewell then."" ""Farewell."" He squeezed my hand tightly, his unusual gleaming eyes locking with mine for a moment, then he abruptly departed, his footsteps resonating along the ship's deck. The sound reverberated in my ears. Footsteps exiting my world. I must confess, the following couple of hours were far from pleasant.",1
"""Pardon my curiosity,"" I exclaimed. Poirot, looking apologetic, extended his hands. ""Forgive me, my friend, you were not entirely receptive."" He then turned to me with a serious expression. ""Can you now understand why he should not be taken into custody?"" ""Maybe,"" I responded skeptically, as I had little concern for Alfred Inglethorp's destiny and believed a scare could benefit him. Poirot, observing me closely, let out a sigh. ""Well, my dear friend,"" he changed the topic, ""aside from Mr. Inglethorp, what were your impressions of the inquest evidence?"" ""Just as I anticipated,"" I replied.",1
"""He observed a figure emerging from Sir Eustace’s quarters and trailed him to the upper deck. Does that align with his statement? Now, who resided in the cabin across from Sir Eustace? Colonel Race. Imagine if Colonel Race stealthily ascended to the deck, and, thwarted in his assault on you, hastily circled the deck and encountered Pagett just entering through the saloon entrance. He strikes him and swiftly retreats inside, shutting the door behind him. We rush over and discover Pagett sprawled on the floor. What do you make of that?” “You overlook the fact that he adamantly insists it was you who struck him down.""",1
"As Pagett made sure to wait until he had eliminated any suspicious activities, I decided to board a tram out of the city and take a leisurely stroll in the countryside. The weather was pleasantly cool, providing a welcome relief after my confined travels and time spent at Muizenberg. It's funny how seemingly insignificant details can have a big impact - like when my shoelace suddenly came undone, causing me to stop and bend down to tie it. Just as I was fixing my shoe, a man turned the corner and nearly collided with me. He quickly tipped his hat, offered a brief apology, and continued on his way.",1
"As I watched the examining magistrate immerse himself in the unfolding mystery, Poirot inquired about M. Giraud's absence. ""Will M. Giraud be joining us?"" he questioned. M. Hautet responded curtly, ""M. Giraud has made it clear that he prefers to handle the case on his own terms."" It was evident that the examining magistrate was not swayed by Giraud's disrespectful behavior. Without further discussion, we proceeded in silence. Poirot walked alongside the examining magistrate, while the commissary and I trailed behind.",1
"“She ushered us in immediately, instructing us to sign our names at the bottom of a lengthy document below her own signature,” Poirot inquired, “Were you able to catch a glimpse of the text above her name?” “No, there was blotting paper obscuring that section,” the witness replied. “And you complied with her instructions regarding where to sign?” “Indeed, I signed first followed by Willum,” the witness confirmed. “What became of the document afterwards?” “She proceeded to slide it into a lengthy envelope, then placed it within a purple box situated on the desk,” the witness explained. “At what time did she initially summon you?” “I would estimate around four o’clock, sir,” the witness recalled.",1
"His cohorts could have used a different method to incapacitate him, but the end goal remains unclear. He is not of much value to them now, given the current circumstances surrounding the Prime Minister. As we made our way to the station, I glanced at the clock. We may uncover more information in France, but the mystery of the Prime Minister's disappearance remains unsolved. At Charing Cross, we were greeted by Mr. Dodge and introduced to Detective Barnes and Major Norman. The search for the missing Prime Minister continues as we delve deeper into the investigation.",1
"""His memory was blank, only recalling a sudden pressure on his face and a desperate fight for freedom. Law enforcement deemed his account credible."" ""Have they uncovered anything else?"" ""Negative."" ""No sign of the PM's corpse? There might be a chance. Yet, it's odd. After the assassination attempt earlier, why the effort to preserve his life now?"" Dodge shrugged. ""It’s clear they'll stop at nothing to stop him from reaching the Conference.""",1
"I waited impatiently for what felt like an eternity before deciding to take matters into my own hands. Casually slipping a few bills into the concierge's hand, I inquired about a mysterious woman I was searching for. Describing her as a petite, dark-haired English lady, I was met with a puzzled expression. ""Perhaps she is American?"" I ventured, growing frustrated with the man's lack of cooperation. Despite my efforts, the concierge insisted that such a woman was not a guest at the hotel.",1
"In a flash Poirot sprang up. “Hastings, quick! Let’s follow him.” We discreetly trailed our target through the winding streets of Merlinville. However, Poirot halted as soon as he noticed the man heading towards the station. “Everything is going according to plan. He fell for the trap. He will head to Abbalac, seeking the non-existent valise left by the supposed foreigners. Ah, my friend, it was all a fabrication of mine.” “So you wanted him out of the picture!” I gasped. “Your insight is truly remarkable, Hastings! Now, shall we proceed to the Villa Geneviève?”",1
"""But he chose his words carefully: “Certainly, the ‘Colonel’ is known for being a generous employer. I believe his ability to shift blame onto others has played a significant role in his achievements. A brilliant mind, truly extraordinary! A firm believer in the principle, ‘If you want something done right, don’t do it yourself!’ Here we all are, implicated and completely at his mercy, yet none of us can find any fault with him.” He stopped, as if anticipating a rebuttal from her, but she simply smiled quietly. “None of us,” he reflected.""",1
"“Tell me the truth, please.” “I guess I can do that,” Lawrence responded softly. “What do you mean by ‘guess’? Your brother doesn’t have kids. You’d get everything, right?” “Indeed.” “Much better,” Heavywether chimed in, with a fierce friendliness. “And you’d also get a hefty sum of money, correct?” “Excuse me, Sir Ernest,” the judge intervened, “these inquiries are irrelevant.” Sir Ernest nodded, and after his initial question, he continued. “You visited the dispensary at the Red Cross Hospital in Tadminster on Tuesday, July 17th, with another visitor, correct?” “Yes.”",1
"""Based on the amount found, she likely ingested at least three-quarters of a grain of strychnine, possibly closer to one full grain,"" the forensic scientist reported.   ""Could this have been accidental?"" inquired the Coroner.   ""Highly improbable. Strychnine isn't a common household poison and is subject to strict regulations,"" the scientist replied.   ""Any clue on how it was administered?""   ""None.""   ""You got to Styles before Dr. Wilkins, correct?""   ""Yes, indeed.""",1
"""Look at him, isn't he a gem?"" Tuppence remarked with excitement, descending the staircase. ""Oh, Julius, he's truly a gem!""   ""Well, he certainly appears to be the real deal. I was mistaken about not seeking his help. Should we head straight back to the Ritz?""   ""I need to take a stroll, I'm too thrilled. Can you drop me off at the park? Or would you like to join me?""   ""I need to refuel,"" he replied. ""And send a couple of cables.""   ""Sure thing. I'll see you at the Ritz at seven. We'll grab dinner upstairs.""",1
"""It was the saints who intervened to stop the train,"" Poirot exclaimed urgently. Without hesitation, he opened the carriage door and leaped onto the tracks. ""Quick, throw out the suitcases and follow me."" I followed his instructions just in time, stepping out right before the train started moving again. ""Now, Poirot,"" I demanded, ""what is the meaning of all this?"" ""I have finally seen the light,"" Poirot replied cryptically. My frustration mounting, I retorted, ""Your enlightenment is lost on me."" ""It should not be,"" Poirot replied solemnly, ""but unfortunately, I fear it is.""",1
"I quickly retreated into the shadows, observing as the man conversed with Guy Pagett. Any lingering doubts I may have had were dispelled by this interaction. Pagett consulted his watch before the two exchanged a few words, after which the man made his way towards the station. It was clear that Pagett had given him instructions, but what were they exactly? Suddenly, my heart raced as the man who had been tailing me approached a policeman in the middle of the road. They engaged in a lengthy discussion, gesturing towards Cartwright's and appearing to explain something. It became clear to me - I was being set up for an arrest, likely on false charges such as pickpocketing.",1
"A young woman named Stella and her husband, Mr. and Mrs. Robinson, move into a flat at Montagu Mansions for an incredibly low rent. There are suspicions surrounding the cheap rent and the mysterious circumstances of previous occupants. Poirot and Hastings take up residence in the same building to investigate further. It is discovered that the previous occupants were involved in a theft of important naval plans, leading to a series of unexpected events.",1
"""My acquaintance, who appeared to be anxiously monitoring the weather, directed a disapproving look at me. “Have you forgotten the superior method of Laverguier? I always adhere to his system. One must center themselves, as you may recall, by turning the head from side to side, inhaling and exhaling, pausing for six counts between each breath.” “Hm,” I hesitated. “You'll surely grow weary of centering yourself and counting to six by the time you reach Santiago, or Buenos Ayres, or wherever your journey concludes.” “Quelle idée! Do you truly believe that I intend to travel to Santiago?” “Mr. Renauld seems to imply it in his correspondence.""",1
"His attire was unkempt, concealing his true identity. Mr. Smith assumed his position. He departed promptly for France. None of the genuine Hersheimmer’s associates caught sight of him prior to his departure; even if they had, the deception was flawless. From that point on, he aligned himself closely with those dedicated to tracking him. He was privy to all their confidential information. There was a single instance where he narrowly escaped exposure. Mrs. Van Hopper discovered his hidden truth. He never intended for such a substantial bribe to be proposed to her.",1
"Mme. Renauld emerged in the doorway after a brief moment. Despite her resolve, her complexion was notably ashen. M. Hautet followed closely behind, offering sympathetic words in a flurry. She gestured for a pause. “Give me a moment, gentlemen, to compose myself.” After a deep breath, she removed her hand from her face and gazed at the lifeless body before her. The extraordinary composure she had displayed thus far crumbled in an instant. “Paul!” she wailed. “My dear husband! Oh, heavens!” With a sudden lurch, she collapsed to the floor in a faint. Without delay, Poirot rushed to her side, checking her vital signs with practiced ease. Once he confirmed her unconscious state, he stepped back.",1
"""The discussion that Foscatini was going to have with these gentlemen seemed very unusual,"" Graves explained. The murder took place at 8:47, indicated by a clock that had stopped at that exact time. The victim's face was described in detail, revealing his olive complexion and distinctive features. Inspector concluded that the case was straightforward, with Signor Ascanio as the main suspect. Ascanio's alibi was later confirmed by the Italian Ambassador, leading to his release. Poirot, however, was not convinced and decided to confront Ascanio about his involvement in the murder. Ascanio, feeling threatened by Poirot, eventually confessed to visiting Foscatini on the morning of the murder.",1
"The man's death is under investigation. Madame Daubreuil is questioned about her relationship with him, but she denies any involvement. Madame Daubreuil is characterized as yielding yet seductive, and she insists on being present during the questioning. The examining magistrate insinuates that she may have known more than she lets on, but she remains defiant and refuses to cooperate, ultimately kicking them out of her house. The magistrate and Poirot part ways, with Poirot commenting on the thoroughness of the French police system.",1
"""Pass it over to me.” She extended her hand. “I will head down. Can you make it halfway, then lower yourself behind the ladder without being seen?” Tommy silently agreed. “There’s a large cabinet in the dim light of the landing. Hide behind it. Hold onto this string. Once I've released the others, pull!” Without waiting for further questions, she swiftly descended the ladder and stood among the group, shouting: “Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu! Qu’est-ce qu’il y a?” The German spun around, cursing at her. “Leave this place.""",1
"""Oh, I dare say it's best for all parties."" ""Was he dangerous?"" ""'Omicidal, d'you mean? Oh, no. 'Armless enough. Persecution mania very acute. Full of secret societies from China that had got him shut up. They're all the same."" I shuddered. ""How long had he been shut up?"" asked Poirot. ""A matter of two years now."" ""I see,"" said Poirot quietly. ""It never occurred to anybody that he might be sane?"" The keeper permitted himself to laugh. ""If he was sane, what would he be doing in a lunatic asylum? They all say they're sane, you know.",1
"""Too much strychnine in this case,"" Poirot remarked, his brow furrowed in thought. It wasn't the first time they had encountered it - from Mrs. Inglethorp's tonic to the sale at Styles St. Mary by Mace, and now, within the very walls of the household. The situation was perplexing, to say the least. Just as I was about to respond, a Belgian interrupted us, announcing a lady looking for me. Startled, I rose from my seat, with Poirot close behind as we made our way downstairs to find Mary Cavendish waiting at the entrance.",1
"""We’ll have to risk it. I’m pleased with your approval of the plan.” He stood up. “Where are you off to?” “To purchase the car, obviously,” Julius replied, taken aback. “What brand are you interested in? I assume you’ll want to take it for a spin before we’re done.” “Oh,” Tuppence murmured weakly, “I prefer Rolls-Royces, but ” “Of course,” Julius agreed. “Your wish is my command. I’ll make it happen.” “But you can’t just yet,” Tuppence exclaimed. “Sometimes people have to wait ages.” “Not little Julius,” Mr. Hersheimmer asserted. “Don’t worry. I’ll be there in the car in thirty minutes.” Tuppence stood up. “You’re incredibly kind, Julius.”",1
"""Poirot, you were right, but why take a risk that could easily be avoided?"" Poirot scoffed at the idea of risk. ""Where was the risk? Would Japp have solved it? No, Number Four would have been fine if not for one small mistake."" ""And what was that mistake?"" I inquired, already knowing the answer. ""My friend, he underestimated Hercule Poirot's little gray cells."" Poirot may have his strengths, but being modest is not one of them. It was a typical mid-January day in London, with its damp and dirty winter weather. Poirot and I sat in chairs by the fire, deep in conversation.",1
"Carter's face turned a shade of purple as he asked, ""How much?"" I quickly pocketed the usual fee of fifty pounds before meeting you outside. We moved on to the next address, ready to repeat the same performance. ""Tommy, don't be ridiculous. Let's see what the other letter says. Oh, it's from the Ritz!"" Upon reading it, I discovered that the offer was for a hundred pounds instead of the usual fifty. It read: ""DEAR SIR, ""Regarding your advertisement, please visit around lunchtime. ""Yours sincerely, ""JULIUS P. HERSHEIMMER."" Tommy let out a small laugh as I finished reading the letter.",1
"I could sense the hopelessness in Poirot's gaze. Together, we pushed against the door with all our strength. From the window, Cinderella's voice pierced through the tension, cool and detached: ""You'll never make it in time. I suppose it's up to me."" Before I could react, she seemed to launch herself into the void. I scrambled to the window and peered out. My heart stopped as I witnessed her hanging from the rooftop, inching her way towards the illuminated window. ""Dear God! She's risking her life,"" I exclaimed. ""Don't forget, Hastings. She's a seasoned acrobat.""",1
"In a swift motion, the physician hurried to the bedside. With urgency, he began moving her arms vigorously, performing what appeared to be artificial respiration. Instructing the staff with quick, precise commands, he gestured imperiously for us to leave the room. Despite our fascination, deep down we all understood that it was already too late. The doctor's face betrayed a glimmer of doubt, indicating his own dwindling optimism. Ultimately, he reluctantly gave up, his solemn expression speaking volumes. Just then, the sound of footsteps approached from outside, and Dr. Wilkins, Mrs. Smith's personal physician, entered the room.",1
"I perched on the edge of my cot, clad in my vibrant gipsy attire, mulling over the predicament. My mind drifted to Colonel Race, who had shown me favor. I believed he would offer compassion and intelligence. However, upon further reflection, doubts crept in. His forceful demeanor could easily overshadow my ownership of the case. It was my puzzle to solve! Unspoken motives lingered, dissuading me from entrusting Colonel Race. My thoughts then turned to Mrs. Blair, another source of kindness.",1
"""He approached the telephone after finishing his conversation, dialing a number that I recognized as belonging to a private detective agency he occasionally utilized. His directions were precise and unambiguous. Two individuals were to head to the provided location and, in broad terms, ensure the safety of Miss Monro. They were instructed to tail her every move. Poirot replaced the receiver and returned to my side. ""Do you believe it's truly necessary, Poirot?"" I inquired. ""It might be. It's evident that we are under surveillance, you and I, and if that's the case, they will soon become aware of our luncheon companion today. Number Four may sense a threat.""",1
"""It is him, over there."" He gestured to a man stepping out of the shadows. To my shock, it was the Prime Minister himself. Eager to unravel the mystery, I pressed Poirot for answers as we drove back to London. The story unfolded - the Prime Minister had been kidnapped on his way to London, not smuggled back as I had assumed. The details of the abduction were revealed, involving a clever plan orchestrated by Captain Daniels. The Prime Minister's double was convincingly portrayed, shielded from anyone who knew him well. As we crossed into France, the deception unraveled, leading to the Prime Minister's disappearance. The man who played the part of the Prime Minister discarded his disguise, leaving behind a trail of confusion.",1
"“Have you heard about our new flat, Mr. Parker?” Mrs. Robinson asked excitedly. “It’s in Montagu Mansions, and it's only eighty pounds a year!” “Montagu Mansions? That’s a big building near Knightsbridge, right?” Parker inquired, surprised. Mrs. Robinson nodded, a worried expression creeping onto her face. “Could it be haunted?” Parker dismissed the idea, declaring he had never heard of a haunted flat. “There were a few odd things, though,” Mrs. Robinson admitted. She went on to explain how they found the flat, despite being told it was already taken. After signing the agreement, they were set to move in the following day. “What a strange story,” Poirot pondered, intrigued by the inexplicable cheapness of the flat.",1
"""The ground floor windows are all secured with iron shutters,” the commissary argued. Poirot gestured towards a first floor window. “Isn't that the bedroom window we just left? Look, there's a tree nearby that would make for an easy climb.” “That's true,” the commissary acknowledged. “But they couldn't have climbed without leaving footprints in the flower-bed.” I understood his point. Two oval flower-beds, filled with scarlet geraniums, flanked the steps to the front door.",1
"She presented me with the promise of Madeira. A glimmer of hope emerged within me. The thought of stepping onto solid ground was enough to lift my spirits. Wrapped in layers of coats and blankets, my legs barely able to support me, I was lifted and placed on a deck chair like a lifeless body. I closed my eyes, filled with resentment towards existence. The purser, a young fair-haired man with an innocent face, approached and took a seat next to me. ""Feeling a bit sorry for yourself, are you?"" he inquired. ""Yes,"" I responded, my dislike for him growing. ""You'll feel like a new person in a day or two. We encountered rough weather in the Bay, but calmer seas lie ahead.""",1
"""Did you know that many famous detectives have brothers who are even more renowned than they are, if only they weren't so lazy?"" Poirot had a way of speaking that made it difficult to tell if he was joking or serious. This was one of those times. ""What's your brother's name?"" I inquired, trying to wrap my head around this new information. ""Achille Poirot,"" Poirot responded solemnly. ""He resides near Spa in Belgium."" ""And what does he do?"" I probed, setting aside my curiosity about the late Madame Poirot and her love for classical names.",1
"""I could not bear the thought of more false rumors spreading, especially with Emily's funeral still ahead,"" confessed Inglethorp. Japp shrugged, replying, ""I'd take rumors over a murder charge any day. Your wife would likely agree. Without Poirot's help, you'd be in a cell by now."" Inglethorp sighed, ""I may have been naive, but you don't understand the harassment I've endured."" He glared at Evelyn Howard. Japp turned to John, saying, ""Show me the lady's room, then I'll talk to the staff.""",1
"""Despite their efforts to escape, Nemesis caught up with them in the end. When news broke of the tragic Air Mail crash to Paris claiming the lives of the Hon. Roger and Mrs. Havering, I felt a sense of justice prevailing. 'There seems to be a surge in bond robberies recently,' I remarked one morning, setting aside the newspaper. 'Poirot, let's leave the art of detection behind and venture into the world of crime instead!' 'Are you trying to get rich quick, my friend?' 'Just consider the latest heist, the million dollars' worth of Liberty Bonds en route from London and Scottish Bank to New York, vanishing mysteriously aboard the Olympia.'""",1
"“I know you did,” she said with a cold stare. “But John! My dear John!” he pleaded. “Every murderer is probably somebody’s old friend,” she mused, staring out the window. “You cannot mix up sentiment and reason,” he replied, lighting a cigarette. “I must say I think you might have given me a hint,” she accused. “Perhaps, my dear, I did not do so, just because he was your old friend,” he explained calmly. She felt a pang of guilt, recalling how she had unknowingly betrayed John based on Poirot's suspicions. John had been cleared of the charges, but his reputation was tarnished.",1
"Miss Marlowe handed the glass to Mrs. Vandemeyer. “Take a sip of this.” The brandy quickly brought color back to the woman's pale face, revitalizing her. Attempting to sit up, Mrs. Vandemeyer winced and fell back, clutching her side. “My heart,” she murmured weakly. “I shouldn't speak.” With closed eyes, she rested back. Dr. Reynolds monitored her pulse for a moment before giving a reassuring nod. “She's stable now.” The three individuals moved aside, conversing quietly. A sense of disappointment lingered among them all.",1
"""He's deceiving me,"" I mused. ""But for what reason?"" ""Has your employer leased the residence? Have there been any unfamiliar faces inside over the past three years?"" ""Negative, sir."" ""Any guests?"" ""Just Miss Violet."" ""No unfamiliar individuals have set foot in this chamber?"" ""None, sir."" ""You're overlooking the laborers, Jim,"" his spouse pointed out. ""Laborers?"" Poirot snapped at her. ""What laborers?"" The lady disclosed that approximately two and a half years ago, workers had been present to perform specific repairs. She was rather unclear on the nature of the repairs. Her belief was that it was a mere whim of her employer's and completely unnecessary.",1
"“I need to find out who unfastened them,” “I have to make my way to Rhodesia,” Mrs. Blair declared. “After the information you shared, Colonel Race, I feel compelled to go. But it's a dreadful journey, five days on the train.” “You should accompany me in my personal railway carriage,” I suggested politely. “Oh, Sir Eustace, that's so kind of you, are you serious?” “Am I serious!” I responded indignantly, taking another sip of champagne. “In just under a week, we'll arrive in South Africa,” Mrs. Blair lamented. “Ah, South Africa,” I mused wistfully, recalling a recent speech I had given at the Colonial Institute.",1
"Rupert had disappeared into the darkness of New York once again, only to meet his end by his own hand. In the note he left behind, there were troubling words that hinted at a deep sense of regret. He described himself as an outcast and a pariah, ultimately concluding that death was his only escape. As I read the letter, a new suspicion crept into my mind. The ancient curse of an Egyptian pharaoh seemed unlikely - perhaps a more recent evil was at play. Could it be that this troubled young man sought to eliminate his uncle, but mistakenly poisoned Sir John Willard instead? The thought lingered in my mind, painting a chilling picture of a man tormented by his own misdeeds.",1
"I wrenched a dagger out of his grasp, and while Poirot revealed his eyes by lowering the scarf covering them but leaving his mouth bound, I raised my gun in plain sight to convey the futility of resistance. As he stopped fighting, Poirot leaned in close to whisper urgently in his ear. Within a minute, the man signaled his understanding. Poirot then gestured for silence and led us out of the apartment and down the staircase. Our prisoner trailed behind, with me bringing up the rear armed with the gun. Once we reached the street, Poirot turned to me. “A taxi is waiting just around the bend. Hand over the gun.”",1
"""He is the foremost expert on the topic, and I needed to ascertain from him if the suggested scenario was at all feasible."" ""And was it?"" I inquired with keen interest. ""That remains uncertain. I have not had the opportunity to speak with Mr. Halliday and it seems unlikely that I will, based on current information."" ""The reality of the situation,"" Japp interjected curtly, ""is that Halliday has vanished."" ""When?"" ""A couple of months back."" ""Was his absence reported?"" ""Indeed it was. His spouse approached us in a state of distress. We took action, but I harbored doubts from the start."" ""Why is that?"" ""It never bodes well when a man goes missing in that manner."" Japp gave a knowing wink.",1
"""She was the picture of silence, barely parting her lips, yet her powerful presence seemed to overshadow us all in a strange way. And what about little Cynthia? Was she onto something? She appeared utterly exhausted and unwell, in my opinion. The weight and lethargy in her demeanor were glaringly obvious. I inquired if she was unwell, to which she candidly replied: “Yes, I’ve got the most wretched headache.” “Would you care for another cup of coffee, mademoiselle?” Poirot asked with concern. “It might do you good. It works wonders for headaches.” He sprang to his feet and reached for her cup.""",1
"Madame Beroldy was a mysterious woman who seemed to have ensnared the hearts of many, including the wealthy Mr. Hiram P. Trapp. However, tragedy struck when Madame Beroldy's husband was found murdered in their apartment. The investigation led to a trial where Madame Beroldy was accused of the crime. Despite the evidence against her, Madame Beroldy's eloquence and charm won the jury over, resulting in her acquittal. Georges Conneau, her lover, was suspected of the crime but never found. The case remained a mystery, with Madame Beroldy eventually leaving Paris with her child to start a new life. The details of the case were carefully examined, revealing the true nature of the characters involved.",1
"""It adds up, also, to M. Renauld's effort to appease her with a check. I believe I will be able to locate her easily with the aid of this."" He then revealed the picture he had removed from Jack Renauld's desk. ""With affection from Bella,"" was written in messy handwriting in the corner, but that was not what captured my attention. The quality of the image was not the best, yet it was undeniably familiar to me. A chill ran down my spine, as if a terrible disaster had struck me. It was the visage of Cinderella.",1
"The detective from Scotland Yard exuded disdain, Major Norman appeared disinterested, and I myself felt time dragging on endlessly. Restlessly, I rose from my seat and made my way to the window without making a sound. The situation was turning into a comedy of errors. Concern for my friend weighed on me. If he were to fail, I wished it would be in a less absurd fashion. I absentmindedly gazed out the window at the departing boat, billowing smoke from its stack at the dock. Poirot's sudden voice near me snapped me back to reality. ""My friends, it's time to go!"" I turned around.",1
"I had my doubts about Mrs. Blair and Anne's obsession with buying wooden animals at every station. The journey through Bechuanaland was filled with dust and primitive charm, as the Kafir children sold their hand-carved toys. The Hex river valley and the Karoo offered breathtaking scenery that was a stark contrast to the chaos of the train stops. Suzanne and I marveled at the sights, almost missing the train at each impromptu halt. The natives appeared out of nowhere, offering their wares, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of wonder at the simplicity and beauty of their creations.",1
"""Can't you provide any more information about him?"" he asked, as I prepared to leave. ""Actually,"" I replied. I took advantage of the opportunity to deliver a final blow. ""His head was notably brachycephalic. He won't be able to change that easily."" I was pleased to see Inspector Meadow's pen hesitate. It was obvious he was unsure how to spell brachycephalic. Fueled by anger, my next move surprisingly felt effortless. I had a vague plan in mind when I entered Scotland Yard.",1
"""I consider it my personal property,"" he stated confidently. However, I viewed the responsibility as the one area where a secretary truly proved their worth. ""Let's book an additional cabin,"" I suggested quickly. The task appeared straightforward, yet Pagett thrived on creating enigmas. The following day, he approached me with the countenance of a Renaissance plotter. ""You instructed me to reserve Cabin 17 as an office, correct?"" ""Yes, what about it? Is the stationery trunk blocking the entrance?"" ""The doorways are identical in all cabins,"" Pagett responded gravely. ""But trust me, Sir Eustace, there's something unsettling about that particular cabin."" Thoughts of The Upper Berth by F. Marion Crawford crossed my mind.",1
"""During your cleaning yesterday, did you happen to spot any wax residue on the floor?"" ""Wax residue? No, sir. Mrs. Inglethorp used a reading-lamp, not candles."" ""If there had been a significant spill of wax on the floor, do you believe you would have noticed it?"" ""Yes, sir. I would have promptly removed it with blotting paper and a hot iron."" Poirot then inquired about a green outfit belonging to the mistress. ""Did your mistress own a green dress?"" ""No, sir."" ""Or a cloak, a cape, or a jacket?"" ""Nothing green, sir."" ""What about anyone else in the household?"" Annie pondered. ""No, sir."" ""You're absolutely certain?"" ""Absolutely sure.""",1
"I asked, trying to appear as indifferent as I could. Mrs. Cavendish was coming down the stairs, looking odd and disturbed. ""Had a good walk with Dr. Bauerstein?"" I suggested a quick game of tennis before supper. Cynthia agreed, so I ran upstairs to fetch my racquet. ""I didn't go,"" she replied abruptly. ""Where is Mrs. Inglethorp?"" ""In the boudoir,"" he replied. He did not seem to have heard her, for without a word he turned on his heel and went out of the house.",1
"I had leaped to my feet and was standing eye to eye with the stranger in the center of the room. There weren't many places to hide in that room for a man of his stature. I swiftly dragged out my heavy trunk, forcing him to crouch behind it and slip beneath the bed. I opened the lid of the trunk, all the while reaching for the wash-basin with my other hand. In one fluid motion, I twisted my hair into a tight bun on top of my head. It might not have been a sophisticated look, but it served its purpose. A woman, with her hair haphazardly tied up and reaching for a bar of soap to wash her neck, would never raise suspicion of aiding a fugitive.",1
"Revealing everything to him seemed like the right move, except for the crucial detail of the papers' location. His assistance in locating Tuppence and Annette was almost convincing, but I remained wary. A forged note from Tuppence confirmed my suspicions. Examining the note, Tommy noticed that while the handwriting matched, the signature did not. Tuppence would never misspell her own name as 'Twopence,' a detail that only someone unfamiliar with her signature would overlook.",1
"“Renauld’s?” My eyes widened in shock. “His anger towards his son, undoubtedly.” “But he wrote affectionate letters to him in Paris?” “That's what Jack Renauld claims, but he has no proof.”“Let's move on from that.”“Now, let's focus on the day of the tragedy. You've organized the morning events in a specific sequence. Is there a reason for that?”“I discovered that the letter to me was sent out at the same time as the telegram. Shortly after, Masters was given time off. In my view, the altercation with the tramp occurred before these incidents.”",1
"Tommy mechanically packed his belongings back at the Ritz, his mind elsewhere. The sudden tragedy had shattered his once cheerful existence. Memories of the fun times with Tuppence flooded his thoughts. It felt unreal that she was gone, so full of life. It had to be a nightmare. A note of sympathy from Peel Edgerton arrived, offering a job on a ranch in the Argentine.",1
"""If I say if, you note Madame Daubreuil was Renauld’s mistress, he had not had time to tire of her. And in any case you mistake her character. She is a woman who can simulate great emotional stress. She is a magnificent actress. But, looked at dispassionately, her life disproves her appearance. Throughout, if we examine it, she had been cold-blooded and calculating in her motives and actions. It was not to link her life with that of her young lover that she connived at her husband’s murder. The rich American, for whom she probably did not care a button, was her objective. If she committed a crime, she would always do so for gain. Here there was no gain.""",1
"“Tommy!” “Yes?” “What did the two men you saw look like?” Tommy furrowed his brow, trying to recall. “One was a large, overweight man. I believe he was clean-shaven and had dark hair.” “That’s him!” exclaimed Tuppence excitedly. “That’s Whittington! What about the other man?” “I can’t quite remember. I didn’t pay much attention to him. It was the strange name that stood out to me.” “Funny how things work out,” remarked Tuppence as she enjoyed her Pêche Melba. Tommy, however, was lost in thought.",1
"""But I have to grab the other tray with the essentials,"" she insisted. Conrad grumbled, ""Well, make it quick."" Ignoring Tommy, the woman approached the table and lifted the tray. In one swift motion, she switched off the light. ""Damn you,"" Conrad's voice boomed as he appeared in the doorway. ""Why did you do that?"" Unfazed, she replied, ""I always turn it off. You should have mentioned it. Do you want me to turn it back on, Monsieur Conrad?"" ""No, let's just go,"" he snapped. Annette chimed in from the darkness, ""Such a handsome gentleman,"" as she lingered by the bed.",1
"""I see,"" said Poirot thoughtfully. ""Perhaps we shall never know."" I felt a shiver run down my spine at the cryptic remark. Poirot always seemed to see more than he let on. As we walked down the dimly lit hallway, I couldn't shake the feeling that there was something dark and sinister lurking just out of sight. The mystery of Mr. Renauld's murder was far from being solved, and I had a sinking feeling that things were about to get a lot more complicated.",1
"The attorney nonchalantly shrugged. ""It has some truth to it, no doubt. But most of the testimony wouldn't hold up in court."" As the hours passed, Sir James pulled back the curtains at the first signs of dawn. They witnessed a rare sight for Londoners - the slow ascent of the sun over the slumbering city. As light filled the room, the fears and imaginations of the previous night seemed trivial. Tuppence's mood lifted back to normal. ""Hooray!"" she exclaimed. ""It's going to be a beautiful day. We'll find Tommy. And Jane Finn. And everything will be wonderful. I'll inquire with Mr.…""",1
"""Tuppence, will you take the lead tonight?"" He indicated the place of honor with a wave of his hand. But Tuppence declined. ""No, that's Jane's spot! After all these years of loyalty, she deserves to be the center of attention this evening."" Julius shot her a thankful look, and Jane timidly approached the designated chair. Her beauty, which was already striking, now appeared even more resplendent. Tuppence had played her role impeccably. The designer dress, named ""A tiger lily,"" had been provided by a renowned fashion house.",1
"“In his suite at Claridge’s, Kramenin reclined on a couch and dictated to his secretary in sibilant Russian. Presently the telephone at the secretary’s elbow purred, and he took up the receiver, spoke for a minute or two, then turned to his employer. “Some one below is asking for you.” “Who is it?” “He gives the name of Mr. Julius P. Hersheimmer.” “Hersheimmer,” repeated Kramenin thoughtfully. “I have heard that name before.” “His father was one of the steel kings of America,” explained the secretary, whose business it was to know everything.”",1
"""If O’Murphy is truly an honest man, what compelled him to veer off the main road? Conversely, if he was a man of deceit, what motivated him to restart the vehicle after only two shots rang out, quite possibly averting the Prime Minister’s demise? Moreover, if he was indeed honorable, why did he promptly head to a notorious haunt of German intelligence operatives upon departing Charing Cross?” “The situation appears rather dubious,” I remarked. “Let us approach this matter systematically. What evidence do we possess regarding these individuals? Let us begin with O’Murphy.""",1
"He handed me a cup of tea, unsweetened and ice cold, precisely at 6 o'clock. I drank it and quickly succumbed to exhaustion, drifting off into a deep sleep. When I awoke, I found myself just outside of Bulawayo, confronted by a grotesque wooden giraffe with elongated legs and neck. Despite these minor setbacks, everything had been proceeding smoothly until a new disaster struck. The incident occurred on the evening of our arrival at the Falls. I was giving dictation to Miss Pettigrew in my private sitting area when Mrs. Blair barged in unannounced, dressed inappropriately. ""Where is Anne?"" she demanded, as if I held the answers. An absurd inquiry, considering I had no control over the girl's whereabouts.",1
"Poirot calmly explained the intricate plan that M. Renauld had devised, ensuring that he would appear to die without actually perishing. The body of the tramp was manipulated to serve as a decoy, while M. Renauld planned to escape to another country under an assumed identity. Madame Renauld was to play the part of the grieving widow until they could reunite in secret. The details were meticulously arranged, from altering the will to staging the body with the aeroplane dagger. The truth behind the elaborate scheme was slowly unraveling, revealing the extent of their desperation and determination to start anew.",1
"""You can mock all you want, but I refuse to be the next target of that cursed Men-her-Ra. If I stay here, he will come after me."" The young man wiped his brow, sweat dripping down his face. Poirot looked away, a strange smile playing on his lips. ""Don't forget, he claimed a victim in New York,"" he said over his shoulder. ""Oh, damn!"" Mr. Harper exclaimed forcefully. ""That young man is clearly on edge,"" Poirot observed thoughtfully. ""Teetering right on the edge."" I glanced at Poirot, intrigued by his mysterious smile, but it revealed nothing. Accompanied by Sir Guy Willard and Dr. Tosswill, we were guided through the excavation site.",1
