"In attendance was Constable Johnson, a fresh face in the Force, resembling a human chick with his downy appearance. The telephone on the desk suddenly rang, prompting the inspector to pick it up with his usual air of importance. ""Yes. Market Basing Police station. Inspector Badgworthy here. What?"" There was a subtle change in the inspector's demeanor as he listened intently to the voice on the other end. As superior to Johnson, so was the inspector to others. ""Yes, my lord. I apologize, my lord? Could you please repeat that?"" A lengthy silence followed, during which a range of emotions flickered across the inspector's normally stoic face.",1
"Inquiry over King Victor was reaching a critical point. The evidence from France had arrived, awaiting confirmation. Lemoine's tactics were about to be put to the test. Anthony remained composed, a smile playing on his lips as he anticipated the next move.",1
"The location appeared abandoned, Anthony estimated, likely vacant for an extended period. An imposing iron gate creaked open reluctantly, with the name on the gatepost barely legible. ""A secluded area,"" Anthony whispered to himself, ""an ideal selection."" After a brief pause, he surveyed the deserted road in both directions before discreetly entering through the squeaky gate and proceeding down the neglected driveway. Pausing to listen, he observed that the house was still a considerable distance away, with absolute silence prevailing.",1
"She sensed a hidden motive as he spoke of the detective bureau's failures. Despite Lemoine's engaging narrative, Virginia noticed his subtle maneuvering through the park. It was clear he had a specific destination in mind, leading them purposefully. Abruptly, he ceased his tale and scanned their surroundings at the drive's intersection near a cluster of trees.",1
"“All right,” said Lord Caterham. “Now if I can only get rid of Fish too,” he continued, feeling his spirits rise. “I thought you liked talking to him about your old books.” “So I do, so I do. So I did, rather. But it gets monotonous when one is always doing all the talking. Fish is interested, but he never volunteers any statements of his own.” “It’s better than doing all the listening,” remarked Bundle. “Like one does with George Lomax.” Lord Caterham shuddered at the memory. “George is all very well on platforms,” said Bundle. “I’ve clapped him myself, though I know all the time that he’s talking nonsense.”",1
"""But why would he be in England?” “That's up to you to decide, sir,” Battle said with a meaningful look. “You understand? You suspect? You are familiar with the incident, I assume oh, yes, it seems you are. I was not in my position, of course, at that time, but I was told the whole account by the late Lord Caterham. A disaster like no other.” “The Koh-i-noor,” Battle pondered. “Shh, Battle!” George quickly glanced around, looking suspicious. “I implore you, do not mention any names. It's best not to. If you must refer to it, use the letter K.” The superintendent's expression turned blank once more.",1
"She stood tall, slender, and dark, with a charmingly boyish face and a resolute demeanor. This was Lady Eileen Brent, also known as Bundle, the eldest daughter of Lord Caterham. She acknowledged the others with a nod before turning her attention to her father. ""I've located him,"" she declared. The inspector hesitated for a moment, thinking the young woman had apprehended the murderer, but quickly understood her true intent. Lord Caterham breathed a sigh of relief. ""That's a relief. What was his response?"" ""He's on his way here immediately.""",1
"""There’s a very tidy little revolution brewing in one of those small republics,” McGrath smirked. “You always had a taste for revolutions anything to stir up some trouble.” “I believe my skills could come in handy over there. Trust me, Jimmy, I can play a significant role in a revolution either side. It beats working an honest job any day.” “I believe I’ve heard that from you before, lad. But this time, the opportunity is in England.” “England? A hero's homecoming after years away.""",1
"He glanced over at Anthony, trying to maintain a calm facade. ""Enjoying a quiet afternoon, Mr. Fish?"" Anthony asked casually. ""Yes, thank you,"" Mr. Fish replied, though his demeanor seemed more tense than usual. His cheeks were red, and he panted slightly, as if he had hurried to get there. Checking his watch, he muttered, ""I suppose it's almost time for that quaint British tradition of afternoon tea."" With a quick click, he shut his watch and strolled leisurely towards the house.",1
"""I've always had a fascination with amateur detective work. Should we head to the crime scene, or would you prefer a rundown of the facts first?"" ""Let's start with the facts."" She took a moment to organize her thoughts before beginning her narrative, speaking in a calm and succinct manner. ""Yesterday, a man visited the house for the first time and requested to see me. He had a collection of letters in his possession love letters, all signed with my name "" ""But none of which were penned by you,"" interjected the young man softly. Virginia regarded him with surprise. ""How did you figure that out?"" ""Just deduction,"" he replied.",1
"""Thrilled, my friend, absolutely thrilled."" Lord Caterham forced a smile, mentioning an urgent meeting with his bailiff before making a quick exit. Spotting Virginia in the hallway, he offered to escort her to breakfast. ""I already ate in bed, thanks. I was so tired this morning,"" she said with a yawn. ""Rough night, huh?"" ""Not entirely rough. Actually, quite the opposite from a certain perspective.""",1
"Lord Caterham cleared his throat. ""Cade was an acquaintance of yours,"" he stated.   ""An old acquaintance,"" Virginia corrected him, her eyes twinkling mischievously as she glanced at Anthony. ""I bumped into him in London yesterday, and mentioned my plans to visit here.""   Anthony nodded approvingly. ""I made it clear to Mrs. Revel,"" he interjected, ""that I had declined your generous invitation because it had been intended for someone else. It wouldn't have been right to deceive you by bringing a stranger into your home.""",1
"He was on the verge of leaving to go visit the restaurant where Giuseppe had worked before when the phone interrupted him. Anthony picked up the phone. “Hello, what’s up?” A flat voice responded. “Is this Mr. McGrath?” “Yes, who is this?” “This is Messrs. Balderson and Hodgkins. Just a moment, please. I’ll transfer you to Mr. Balderson.” “Our trusted publishers,” Anthony pondered. “So they’re getting anxious too, huh? No need. There’s still a week to go.” A lively voice suddenly came through. “Hello! Is this Mr. McGrath?” “Yes.” “I’m Mr. Smith.”",1
"McGrath had instructed Anthony to wait until he could speak with Mr. George Lomax and other important figures before taking action. The invitation to visit Chimneys as Lord Caterham's guest was shrouded in mystery, which Anthony found intriguing. He expressed fondness for England, despite its apparent lag in time. Anthony considered the possibility of staying at an inn as Mr. Anthony Cade to avoid detection.",1
"During Giuseppe's employment at two of the hotels under scrutiny, significant thefts had occurred without any suspicion falling on him. This raised questions about his true motives. Perhaps Giuseppe was more than just a skilled hotel thief, using his job as a cover for his criminal activities. The incident with Anthony's suit-case could have been a calculated move, with Giuseppe seizing the opportunity to conceal the packet of letters when the light was turned on. This would suggest a simple act of theft, rather than anything more sinister. However, the memory of Giuseppe's excitement upon seeing the papers on the table the night before cast doubt on this theory.",1
"""Lord Caterham,"" he exclaimed, ""I regret the inconvenience I have caused you. However, I am confident that tonight will bring an end to the enigma."" Lord Caterham's expression softened. He had always harbored a fondness for Anthony. ""No trouble at all,"" he responded warmly. ""Your efforts are greatly appreciated,"" Anthony acknowledged. ""Since we are all present, I shall proceed with the investigation."" ""I fail to comprehend,"" George Lomax interjected solemnly. ""This situation is highly unorthodox. Mr. Cade lacks the necessary credentials. The circumstances are quite complex and sensitive. In my view "" George's impassioned speech was abruptly halted.",1
"Glancing through the window, they saw a small red-haired man sitting at a table covered in letters. Frowning in frustration, he scribbled away on a sheet of paper, occasionally pausing to rub his nose vigorously. Looking up, he grumbled, ""Battle, why bother me with this nonsense? It's child's play, even a two-year-old could solve it with ease.""",1
"""Anthony frantically searched the deceased man's pockets. ""He's been completely robbed,"" he declared. ""There's nothing left. There's some shady business going on with those letters. Wait, what's this? A hole in the lining something was ripped out, and a piece of paper was left behind."" As he talked, he pulled out the scrap of paper and examined it under the light. Virginia came closer. ""It's a shame we don't have the whole thing,"" he mumbled. ""Chimneys 11.45 Thursday Seems like a meeting."" ""Chimneys?"" exclaimed Virginia.",1
"""Sunlight,"" he muttered, stifling a yawn. ""The thrill has come to an end."" Lemoine got up too. ""I must bid you farewell,"" he declared. ""Our paths may cross again later."" Giving Virginia a nod, he exited through the window. ""Time for bed,"" Virginia said, tired. ""It's been quite a night. Let's hit the hay, Bill, and skip breakfast."" Anthony remained by the window, watching M. Lemoine disappear into the distance.",1
"“Cade?” “How about we meet tomorrow after the inquest? I could return by Sunday evening.” “I understand,” said the superintendent firmly. “So, what’s the plan?” “I’m fine with it, as long as you stick to your word and come straight back here after.” “You’re quite the remarkable man, Battle. Either you’ve developed a sudden liking for me or you’re hiding something. Which is it?” Superintendent Battle gave a small smile, but remained silent. “Well, well,” Anthony remarked, “I’m sure you’ll have your precautions in place. The watchful eyes of law enforcement will follow my every move. So be it.”",1
"Scrawled on the paper in a messy scrawl were the words: “Beware of Mr. Smith. He’s not who you think.” Anthony glanced at it briefly before chuckling. “Is that all? Come on, Battle. I’m more than meets the eye, you know.” With a carefree whistle, he made his way indoors. However, once alone in his bedroom, his expression darkened. Sitting on the bed, he stared broodingly at the ground. “This situation is escalating,” Anthony muttered. “I need to take action. It's a sticky situation....” After a moment of contemplation, he ambled over to the window.",1
"""I am telling you, Mr. McGrath, there is a dangerous group of individuals trying to stop the information from getting to this office,"" Anthony exclaimed. ""If you try to deliver it yourself, chances are you won't make it here."" McGrath, however, was not easily intimidated. ""I am not one to back down from a challenge,"" he confidently replied. As the two men continued their conversation, it became clear that they were in deep waters, surrounded by bribery, threats, and deception.",1
"“Before breakfast,” Lord Caterham complained, “Who else have you spoken to?” “Cade. He was up early today. He’s sticking around. I can’t quite figure him out, but I do like him.” “Virginia does too,” Bundle remarked casually. “And so do I. But that’s beside the point.” “I also invited Isaacstein,” Lord Caterham added. “And?” “But he has to return to town. Remember to schedule the car for 10.”",1
"""Intuition,"" Battle murmured. ""Similar to that of a canine.""   ""I found it to be a rather inconvenient intuition,"" he continued. ""I feared it might inadvertently reveal our plans to you. I suppose I should go and hear him out."" With that, he exited through the window.  Superintendent Battle, now on his own, watched him depart before turning his attention to the wall paneling. ""He will suffice,"" he muttered.   Meanwhile, Boris was outside providing an explanation. ""Master,"" he began, gesturing towards the terrace. Anthony trailed behind, curious about what was unfolding. Eventually, Boris halted and pointed ahead with his finger. Bathed in moonlight, they could see a stone bench occupied by two figures.",1
"The Parisian actress was highly praised for her performance, but her success was short-lived. The Comrades of the Red Hand, angered by her betrayal, made two failed attempts on her life. Their actions sparked a revolution that resulted in the deaths of the King and Queen, whose bodies were found brutally mutilated. This tragic event highlighted the intense hatred towards the foreign Queen.",1
"""Anthony tossed his cigarette aside and walked over to his friend, giving him a friendly pat on the back. “You really are a true hero, Jimmy,” he remarked. “Canada's wilderness should be grateful for your presence. I won't carry out the task with as much finesse as you would.” “So, you'll handle it then?” “Absolutely.” McGrath stood up, went to a drawer, grabbed a stack of letters, and tossed them onto the table. “Take a look at these,” he suggested. “Is it really needed? Frankly, I'd prefer not to.”",1
"""I might just decide to end it all one of these days,"" he muttered with a heavy heart. ""Oh, Bill, don't be so dramatic. Remember that night you took that charming girl out for supper?"" Mr. Eversleigh was momentarily taken aback. ""If you're referring to Dorothy Kirkpatrick from Hooks and Eyes, I must say she's a proper young lady, as innocent as can be. Nothing wrong with that."" ""Bill, my dear, I want you to have fun. But please, spare me the theatrics about a broken heart."" Regaining his composure, Mr. Eversleigh responded, ""You completely misunderstand, Virginia,"" he stated sternly.",1
"I presented myself to you as Mr. James McGrath - however, you must acknowledge that the deception at play was minimal. You are likely familiar with Shakespeare's musings on the insignificance of names? This situation mirrors that sentiment. The individual you sought was the one holding the Memoirs. That individual was me. As you are aware, I am no longer in control of said Memoirs. Quite the clever maneuver. Baron, an exceptionally clever maneuver. Was it your design, or that of your employer?"" ""It was His Highness's own concept. He would not allow anyone other than himself to execute it.""",1
"""I returned from Ranelagh and discovered that a fake telegram had lured all the servants out of the house except for my maid. When I entered the study, I found the man lying there, a victim of a gunshot wound.""  ""Who granted him access?""   ""I cannot say. If my maid had let him in, she would have informed me.""  ""Does she know what transpired?""  ""I have kept her in the dark.""  The young man nodded, standing up. ""Time to examine the body,"" he stated energetically. ""Remember, honesty is the best policy. Lies only lead to more lies, and deceit becomes tiresome.""",1
"""Battle, do you suspect King Victor's involvement in this crime?""  ""It's a possibility. If you recall, there were four potential hiding spots for the jewel, one being Chimneys. King Victor was apprehended in Paris shortly after the K went missing. There was always hope he would eventually reveal the jewel's location.""  ""Chimneys has been thoroughly searched multiple times.""  ""Indeed,"" Battle replied sagely.",1
"I keep sending message after message, but I receive no information about his background. A decade back, he resided in Canada, yet since then nothing. My doubts intensify. One day, I stumble upon a torn note he recently handled. It contains an address the location of a residence in Dover. Subsequently, I deliberately drop the same note. From the corner of my eye, I observe Boris, the Herzoslovakian, retrieve it and deliver it to his superior. I have always been convinced that Boris is a messenger of the Comrades of the Red Hand. We are aware that the Comrades are collaborating with King Victor in this matter.",1
"In front of Anthony lay a motionless figure, with a face that looked out of place in the dimly lit room. The man was tightly restrained, unable to move an inch. Meeting Anthony's gaze, he seemed to be struggling to make sense of the situation. As Anthony leaned in for a closer look, a sudden noise from behind caused him to whirl around, his instincts kicking in. Before he could react, a stern voice rang out. ""Hands where I can see them, boy. Surprised to see me? Well, we just happened to be on the same train from Victoria."" It was Mr. Hiram Fish, his face betraying a hint of amusement as he brandished a gleaming blue firearm.",1
"Anthony expressed his fascination with international politics before abruptly leaving, citing an appointment in the schoolroom. Upon arriving, he was enthusiastically greeted by Guggle and Winkle, who excitedly introduced him to Mademoiselle. A sudden sense of unease washed over Anthony.",1
"“We'll have to deliver the news to them when they arrive, I guess.” He sighed. “I wonder who killed him,” said Bundle. “And why?” “That's not our concern, thankfully,” said Lord Caterham. “That's for the authorities to uncover. Not that Badgworthy will be of any help. I almost wish it was Nosystein.” “Meaning” “The All British Syndicate.” “But why would Mr. Isaacstein kill him when he specifically came here to meet him?” “High finance,” said Lord Caterham vaguely. “And speaking of which, I wouldn't be surprised if Isaacstein was an early riser. He might show up at any moment.""",1
"Bundle, Lord Caterham, and a group of terrified servants huddled together in the entrance of the Council Chamber. ""What's going on?"" inquired Bundle anxiously. ""Are we under attack? Virginia, why are you and Mr. Fish out and about at this hour?"" Virginia recounted the evening's events, to which Bundle remarked, ""How thrilling."" ""A murder and a burglary in one weekend is quite the spectacle. And what's with the lights in here? They're fine everywhere else."" The mystery of the lights was quickly solved when it was discovered that the bulbs had been carefully removed and lined up against the wall.",1
"""Would you be willing to extend the same offer for a loan under the same conditions to his cousin Nicholas?"" ""Can you bring him forward? Wasn't he reported dead in the Congo?"" ""He was indeed. I was the one who spread that rumor. Don't worry, I'm no killer. By saying I killed him, I mean I faked his death. You were promised a Prince, Mr. Isaacstein. Will I suffice?"" ""You?"" ""Yes, that would be me. Nicholas Sergius Alexander Ferdinand Obolovitch. Quite a mouthful for the lifestyle I had in mind, so I reemerged from the Congo as the simple Anthony Cade."" Little Captain Andrassy leaped to his feet.",1
"""I doubt I'll have another opportunity like this."" ""You're hopeless, Jimmy. A grand in hand is worth more than an abundance of mythical gold."" ""But what if it's all a scam? Regardless, I've already booked my passage to Cape Town and then you show up!"" Anthony stood and lit a cigarette. ""I see where you're going with this, James. You continue with the gold hunt as planned, and I take the grand for you. What's in it for me?"" ""How about a quarter?"" ""Two-fifty pounds tax-free, is that the deal?"" ""Exactly.""",1
"“There’s always a way out,” gloomily remarked Anthony. “I’ve always believed that one can achieve anything by paying the price. And what is that price, you ask? Compromise. It’s a dreadful thing, compromise, but it creeps up on you as you approach middle age. It’s creeping up on me now. I’d even consider taking up steady work to win over the woman I desire.” Virginia chuckled. “I was actually trained in a profession,” Anthony revealed. “And you chose to leave it behind?” “Yes.” “Why?” “A matter of principle.” “I see.” “You’re quite an extraordinary woman,” Anthony declared suddenly, turning to gaze at her.",1
Badgworthy couldn't contain his excitement. A murder at Chimneys meant he was in charge of the case. Promotion and kudos were surely on the horizon. But the thought of Scotland Yard interfering dampened his spirits. He knew it was a possibility under the circumstances.,1
"""He grinned, observing the shocked look on the others' faces. ""We've been waiting for this colleague for quite some time,"" he revealed. ""M. Lemoine, from the Sûreté in Paris."" All eyes were fixed on the French detective, who returned their gaze with a smile. ""Indeed,"" he confirmed. After a moment of silence as everyone processed the information, Virginia turned to Battle. ""Superintendent Battle, I have a theory,"" she began. ""What's your theory, Mrs. Revel?"" he inquired. ""I believe it's time for some clarity,"" she suggested. ""Clarity? I'm not sure I follow, Mrs. Revel.",1
"""Anthony, this is quite extraordinary,"" remarked Tredwell. ""The Council Chamber once again. Do you think they gained entry that way?"" Anthony nodded thoughtfully. ""It is believed that they broke in through the window."" Tredwell, pleased with Anthony's interest, started to walk away but suddenly stopped, turning back with a formal apology. ""I apologize, sir. I didn't realize you had entered, standing so close behind me."" Mr. Isaacstein, who had been startled by the sudden movement, waved his hand dismissively. ""No need to worry, my friend. All is well, I assure you.""",1
"""The Council Chamber is where I'd like to have a word with Mr. Cade,"" he stated. ""I'll need him to accompany me there."" ""By all means,"" Lord Caterham replied. ""Feel free to use any space you require."" Anthony and the investigator exited together. The crime scene no longer held the body. A dark mark on the floor was the only reminder of what had taken place. Sunlight streamed in through the trio of windows, illuminating the room and highlighting the aged paneling. Anthony surveyed the room, nodding in satisfaction.",1
"""It felt like a tightening noose, constricting her with each passing moment. Every buried suspicion surged to the forefront of her mind. Anthony wrapped his hand with a handkerchief before picking up the gun. “We must tread carefully,” he remarked, mindful of leaving evidence behind. In an instant, his demeanor shifted. His voice turned cold and abrupt. “Mrs. Revel,” he inquired, “are you familiar with this firearm?” Virginia shook her head in confusion.""",1
"""Stop following me around, it's suspicious,"" Anthony said as Boris handed him a crumpled paper with an address on it. Confused, Anthony asked why Boris brought it to him. Without answering, Boris left. Anthony, feeling uneasy, pocketed the paper and returned to Virginia.",1
"“You wouldn’t catch me burdening you with a dead body, only to act like a stranger the next time we crossed paths. Absolutely not!” She stopped, then added, “You know what’s got me thinking? There seems to be an added layer of intrigue surrounding those Memoirs that we haven’t quite unraveled yet.” “You may be onto something,” Anthony concurred. “There’s something I’m curious about,” he pressed on. “And what might that be?” “Why the shock when I brought up Jimmy McGrath’s name yesterday at Pont Street? Have you heard of him before?” “Indeed I have, my dear Sherlock Holmes.”",1
"""It will be kept quiet, hopefully. You can understand my feelings about family secrets."" ""Mr. Lomax can be trusted, sir. No one will find out. Well, quite a few people will know, but it won't spread."" ""Was that what you wanted to discuss with me?"" ""No, sir - that was just a passing thought. I was wondering why you decided to change your name - if I may be so bold?"" ""Not at all. I'll explain. I changed my name for the best reasons, Battle. My mother was English, I had been educated in England, and I was much more interested in England than in Herzoslovakia. I felt ridiculous traveling the world with a name that sounded like it belonged in a comedy. You see, when I was young, I believed in democracy.""",1
"Mr. Cade and McGrath stood a few feet away from each other. ""What's your plan with these women?"" McGrath asked. ""Starting a harem,"" Anthony replied with a grin. ""Not with this group,"" McGrath retorted. ""Have you really examined them closely?"" ""I have,"" Anthony confirmed.",1
"""I thought that was the right thing to do,"" Lord Caterham said. The inspector nodded in agreement, pulling out his notebook. ""Who found the body? Was it you?"" Lord Caterham chuckled, ""No, not me. It was a housemaid. She made quite a scene, from what I heard. Then they woke me up and I went down to see for myself."" The inspector pressed, ""Did you know the person who died?"" Lord Caterham hesitated at the question.",1
"In the end, he convinced himself that he must have imagined the noise, or possibly confused it with a stray gunshot from a poacher in the nearby woods. Turning back, he retraced his path through the park, feeling a sense of vague dissatisfaction and unease. Glancing towards the house, he noticed a sudden flicker of light in one of the first-floor windows. Within moments, it disappeared, leaving the entire area shrouded in darkness once more. Inspector Badgworthy sat in his office at 8.30 A.M., a tall and portly figure with a heavy, deliberate stride, known to audibly exhale during moments of professional tension.",1
"“He didn’t think I was so innocent at first,” Anthony replied, avoiding Virginia's gaze. “But now he’s convinced, or at least that’s what he wants us to think.” Virginia raised an eyebrow, clearly skeptical. “Well, I suppose we’ll just have to trust Scotland Yard on this one,” she said with a sigh.",1
"""Very well,"" Lord Caterham declared, eager for an exit. ""I shall take my leave, inspector. If you need me, I will be within reach. However, Mr. George Lomax will be arriving from Wyverne Abbey soon, and he is more knowledgeable about the situation. It is truly his domain. I am unable to elaborate, but he will provide the necessary information."" Lord Caterham hastened away without waiting for a response. ""Poor Lomax,"" he grumbled. ""He should not have involved me in this. Tredwell, what is it?"" The elderly butler stood close by, showing respect. ""I have presumed, my lord, to move up the breakfast time specifically for your convenience.",1
"“No, I don’t need all the details of your plan, just the basics, but it sounds important,” Isaacstein nodded. “It’s a major operation.” “Which leads me to my next question. Who is in line to inherit the throne of Jelenia?” Isaacstein glanced at Lomax. Lomax hesitated before responding reluctantly, “Most likely Prince Nicholas would be the next in line.” “I see,” Battle remarked. “And who exactly is Prince Nicholas?” “He’s a close relative of Prince Michael.” “Interesting,” Battle mused.",1
"""We will return, if you don't mind. I simply wanted to survey the area, in a manner of speaking."" After a short while, they arrived back at the entrance with panels. ""Let's begin from this point,"" Battle declared. ""Seven straight, eight to the left, three to the right. Use the first as steps."" He took seven precise steps, then stooped to inspect the ground. ""Seems accurate, in my opinion. At some point, a chalk mark was placed here. Now, eight to the left. It's not steps, the corridor is too narrow for anything but single file."" ""Explain it using bricks,"" Anthony proposed.",1
"""Are there riches there?” inquired Jimmy eagerly. “Most certainly,” replied Anthony. “It's a land of opportunity.” “So you're following my suggestion and heading there?” “Indeed,” affirmed Anthony. “Your guidance was more valuable than you realize. Now, for the bombshell. I wasn't switched at birth, or anything of that nature, but nonetheless I am truly Prince Nicholas Obolovitch of Herzoslovakia.” “Oh, Anthony,” exclaimed Virginia. “How delightfully absurd! And I am your spouse! What shall we do about this?” “We shall journey to Herzoslovakia and masquerade as royalty.”",1
"""They were energetic young girls aged twelve and ten, possibly named Dulcie and Daisy, although commonly referred to as Guggle and Winkle. They engaged in a lively dance, punctuated by loud shouts until Bundle intervened and silenced them. ""Where's Mademoiselle?"" she inquired. ""She's suffering from a headache, a headache, a headache!"" sang Winkle. ""Hooray!"" added Guggle. Lord Caterham had managed to guide the majority of his guests inside. He then placed a calming hand on Anthony's shoulder. ""Follow me to my study,"" he whispered.""",1
"""Is that so?"" ""At the Happy Hound they believed him to be a Count Stanislaus or similar."" ""Inform him,"" Battle instructed George Lomax. George hesitated, but eventually revealed: ""The man posing as Count Stanislaus was actually His Highness Prince Michael of Herzoslovakia."" Anthony let out a low whistle. ""Well, that's quite the predicament,"" he commented. Superintendent Battle, observing Anthony intently, grunted in approval and stood up suddenly.",1
"""I have no choice but to leave the country. The pressure on my nerves” Bundle cut in abruptly. “What was his exact words?” “He mentioned that anyone who desired to could depart.” “Well,” replied Bundle, “that’s settled then. It’s what you’ve been desiring.” “I understand that. However, he didn’t stop there. He proceeded to express his wish for everyone to remain.” “I’m puzzled,” said Bundle, scrunching up her nose. “So perplexing and inconsistent,” grumbled Lord Caterham. “And all this before we’ve even had breakfast.” “What was your response?” “I simply agreed, as always. There's no point in arguing with such individuals.""",1
"""Feel free to depart the premises at your leisure. Additionally, I kindly request that his lordship consider encouraging his visitors to prolong their stay. Sir, madam, your acceptance is appreciated. By the way, has the firearm been located?"" inquired Anthony abruptly. ""The one used to harm Prince Michael, correct? Regrettably, it remains undiscovered. Nevertheless, it is likely within the vicinity. Following your suggestion, Mr. Cade, I will dispatch some youngsters to search for it. Securing the revolver and the collection of correspondence could significantly advance our investigation.""",1
"""Could it be that she was actually meeting her partner in crime, King Victor, who arrived from abroad? What are your thoughts on that?"" Anthony replied with a sigh, ""Are you still on about this, Lemoine? You just don't give up! Can't you see that I have a surprise waiting for you?"" However, George, whose thought process was slower, finally interjected, ""I am still lost. Who is this woman, Baron? It seems like you know her?"" The Baron, standing tall and rigid, corrected him, ""You are mistaken, Mr. Lomax.""",1
"“But the key is never knowing where to search. Let’s imagine that King Victor arrived to find the object, only to be caught off guard by Prince Michael, who he then shot.”   “It’s a possibility,” George responded. “A plausible theory for the murder.”  “I wouldn’t be too hasty. It’s possible, but not much beyond that.”  “Why do you say that?”  “Because King Victor has never shown a tendency towards violence,” Battle remarked gravely. “Oh, but a man like him a dangerous criminal”  But Battle interrupted with a dissatisfied expression. “Criminals always adhere to their nature, Mr. Lomax. It’s remarkable. Nevertheless”  “Yes?”  “I’m inclined to question the Prince’s servant.”",1
"""The first suspect followed the rules, while the second did not. I handled them both with care. However, my problems did not end there. Later that evening, my hotel room was broken into, and a waiter attempted to burglarize it."" Superintendent Battle inquired, ""You didn't notify the authorities, correct?"" I replied, ""No, I didn't. Nothing was stolen. But I did inform the hotel manager, who can verify that the waiter in question disappeared suddenly in the middle of the night.""",1
"""The superintendent abruptly changed the subject. ""Could you find Mr. Eversleigh for me? Mr. Lomax has a message for him to head to the Abbey immediately."" Anthony agreed, noting the car outside the door. ""He's likely still in bed."" ""I disagree,"" the detective replied. ""Take a look, he's walking with Mrs. Revel under the trees."" Anthony left, remarking, ""Impressive observation skills, Battle."" He passed on the message to Bill, who was visibly annoyed.""",1
"“Chin up,” Bundle reassured, “We’ve seen the last of Mr. Fish, I’m sure.” Lord Caterham, in an ornery mood, grumbled, “It’s your friend who’s to blame for this mess. Why must he convene his Board meetings in my home? Why not rent a proper venue like The Larches or Elmhurst, or a villa in Streatham?” Bundle dismissed his concerns, saying, “We’re safe here, I promise.” Lord Caterham, still uneasy, asked, “No foul play to worry about, I hope?”",1
"He sighed in frustration, checking his watch. After refueling the car, he headed north. Arriving near Chimneys Park around 11:30, he quickly scaled the wall and raced towards the house. The massive Chimneys estate appeared before him, illuminated by the distant chime of a clock at 11:45, the same time noted on the mysterious scrap of paper. Anthony stood on the terrace, gazing up at the imposing structure.",1
"""Now, my friends, what is there in this residence that is meticulously organized? Books, correct? Additionally, within Lord Caterham's library inventory, there is a publication titled The Life of the Earl of Richmond. By focusing on this specific volume and utilizing the numerical system to identify shelves and books, I believe you will discover that the intended item is hidden within a decoy book or a hollow space behind a specific book."" Anthony glanced around humbly, clearly anticipating approval. ""Truly, that is quite clever,"" remarked Lord Caterham.",1
"""But I highly doubt that the Obolovitch dynasty has completely died out. There are likely numerous young individuals, perhaps cousins or distant relatives, still around."" ""So locating a potential King wouldn't be a challenge?"" ""I don't think so,"" Jimmy responded. ""I can understand why they might grow weary of Republican systems. Such a strong and lively population must find it dull to target Presidents after being accustomed to Kings. And speaking of Kings, that brings to mind another revelation old Stylptitch made that evening.""",1
"As he inquired about the way to Hurstmere on Langly Road, a faint smile played on his lips. The road stretched far, extending beyond the town's limits. Following the porter's guidance, Anthony made his way towards the final destination. A sense of anticipation mingled with the crease between his brows, signaling his readiness for the impending danger. Situated at the end of Langly Road, Hurstmere was a solitary dwelling surrounded by unkempt, sprawling grounds.",1
"""I have witnessed many intriguing events over the past forty-eight hours,"" I confidently stated. Bill leaned in, his curiosity piqued. ""Can you please clarify what transpired last night?"" he inquired. M. Lemoine hesitated before responding, ""I must admit, I may have put you through a rather strenuous ordeal."" Bill's eyes widened in realization, ""So it was you I was pursuing?"" M. Lemoine nodded, ""Indeed. Allow me to elucidate. I ascended to this vantage point with the belief that the key to the mystery lay within this very room, the same room where the Prince met his demise. I positioned myself outside on the terrace, observing intently. It wasn't long before I detected movement inside. The faint glow of a flashlight confirmed my suspicions. Testing the middle window, I discovered it was unlocked.""",1
"Giuseppe had been employed at the restaurant in question, but his private life and connections remained a mystery to all. Anthony vowed under his breath, ""I will catch you, my boy. It's just a matter of time."" His second night in London passed without incident. The next morning at nine o'clock, Mr. Holmes from Balderson and Hodgkins arrived and collected the manuscript. A slight, unassuming man, Mr. Holmes handed Anthony a check for a thousand pounds in return. After packing up the manuscript in his small brown bag, Mr. Holmes bid Anthony farewell and left.",1
"""The match-box slipped from Anthony's grasp, leaving him stunned. Battle's disbelief mirrored his own. ""Can it be?"" ""Indeed, my dear friend. The headlines tomorrow will confirm it. A masterful deception. Prince Nicholas, long thought dead in the Congo, resurfaces. King Victor capitalizes on the unverifiable demise, orchestrating a grand scheme to swindle American dollars under the guise of oil concessions.""",1
"Clement Brent, the ninth Marquis of Caterham, was a modestly dressed man with a demeanor quite different from what one would expect of a Marquis. His dull blue eyes, slender nose, and polite but distant manner set him apart. Lord Caterham's biggest misfortune was inheriting his brother's title four years prior. The previous Marquis had been a prominent figure, well-known throughout England for his political career and the renowned hospitality of his estate, Chimneys.",1
"""I've already eaten, and even if I hadn't, I wouldn't be hungry. We need to figure out our next move. Have you confided in anyone yet?"" ""Just Bundle, myself, the local police, Cartwright, and all the servants."" George sighed. ""Get yourself together,"" Lord Caterham said gently. ""(You really should eat something.) You can't keep a murder quiet. We have to bury the body and deal with the consequences. It's a terrible situation, but we have no choice."" George composed himself. ""You're correct, Caterham.",1
"""Whoa! It's a woman,"" he gasped. ""I apologize, Mrs. Revel. I mistook you for a criminal on the run."" Virginia exclaimed, out of breath. ""Did he just go by here? Can we still catch him?"" She knew it was futile as soon as the words left her mouth. The man had likely made it to the park by now, and the night was pitch black. Virginia and Mr. Fish made their way back to the Council Chamber, with him rambling on about the typical behaviors of burglars, a subject he appeared well-versed in.",1
"""The case is a brutal one,"" Anthony muttered. ""I'm done with this, utterly defeated."" Bundle silently acknowledged before continuing to drive. Anthony flagged down a taxi, instructing the driver to head to Victoria Station. Upon arrival, Anthony paid the fare and inquired about the next train to Dover, only to find out he just missed it. Resigned to waiting for over an hour, Anthony paced back and forth with a furrowed brow. As he impatiently shook his head a few times, the journey to Dover remained uneventful. Once at the station, Anthony swiftly exited, but then abruptly turned back, as if something had just struck him.",1
"""George, I can’t stop thinking about it. The things that Bill deems crucial are incredibly narrow-minded. I’m seriously considering giving up on the whole Ranelagh situation. I mean, Ranelagh will always be there. Let George know that I’ll be patiently waiting for him at four o’clock.” George glanced at his watch. “There’s no point in going back before lunch. Let’s grab a bite to eat, Virginia.” “I already have plans for lunch,” Virginia replied. “Doesn’t matter. Take the day off and forget about everything,” George suggested. “That actually sounds lovely,” Virginia said with a smile. “You know, Virginia, you’re amazing. Just tell me, you do have some affection for me, right? More than for other people.""",1
"Jimmy shook his head. ""It's hard to say. Count Stylptitch seemed like a decent man to me.""",1
"""Let's save him for last,"" George said, nodding to the superintendent. The bell rang, Tredwell answered, and soon a tall fair man with high cheekbones and deep-set blue eyes entered the room. ""Boris Anchoukoff?"" ""Yes, I was Prince Michael's valet,"" he replied with a harsh foreign accent.",1
"A woman in search of a level-headed, unemotional man to help her navigate a difficult situation. Not George, too self-interested. Bill, on the other hand, seemed like the perfect fit. But when she tried to reach him, she discovered he had already left for Chimneys. Frustrated, she slammed down the receiver, feeling the weight of the situation closing in around her.",1
"Still she hesitated. Frozen in place, a wave of fear and uncertainty gripped her tightly. Was the fake telegram connected to all of this? What if Élise hadn't stayed home? She would have entered, only to discover a lifeless body - a man she had allowed to blackmail her before. Though she had a justification prepared, doubt lingered. George had dismissed it as unbelievable.",1
"“Virginia is quite intelligent,” she stated suddenly. “She may spout nonsense, but she is definitely smart. I heard she excelled in Herzoslovakia. If Tim Revel had survived, he would have been very successful largely thanks to Virginia. She supported him wholeheartedly. She went above and beyond for him and I understand why.” “Was it because she loved him?” Anthony asked, his gaze fixed straight ahead. “No, it was because she didn’t.”",1
"""By around ten-thirty we had gone up,” Lord Caterham stated. “Can you please provide me with a rundown of everyone present in the residence?” Superintendent Battle inquired. “I thought the perpetrator came from outside?” “He likely did. Nonetheless, I still need to identify the occupants. It's standard procedure,” replied Battle. “There was Prince Michael, his valet, and Mr. Herman Isaacstein. You're familiar with them. Additionally, there was Mr. Eversleigh” George interjected, “He's in my department.”",1
"As he stood in the shadows of the room, Anthony's eyes were fixed on the door, not the window. Virginia crouched behind a suit of armor on the opposite wall, while Bill kept watch by the window. Time seemed to drag on endlessly as the clock chimed one o'clock, then the half-hour, two o'clock, and another half-hour. Stiff and cramped, Anthony couldn't shake the feeling that the danger was lurking just outside.",1
"""Does this tale tie back to the previous case?” “Not at all, but funny enough, he was Herzoslovakian. We nicknamed him Dutch Pedro.” Anthony responded nonchalantly. “Any name suits a foreigner,” he quipped. “Let's focus on the task at hand, James.” “He seemed appreciative, stuck by me like a loyal dog. Sadly, he succumbed to fever six months later. I was by his side.""",1
"""I need to confess that during my altercation with the server Giuseppe, I managed to snatch a small piece of paper from him. At the time, the words scribbled on it meant nothing to me, but the mention of Chimneys triggered my memory. Retrieving the torn scrap, I scrutinized it. It confirmed my suspicions. The paper in question is here, gentlemen, take a look for yourselves. The inscription reads ‘Chimneys 11.45 Thursday.’” Battle closely inspected the paper. “It's possible,” Anthony went on, “that the word Chimneys is unrelated to this establishment. However, it's also possible that it is. And without a doubt, this Giuseppe was a deceitful scoundrel.""",1
"""Did you hear that the old Baron has a very high opinion of you? He talks about you with great enthusiasm."" Anthony responded, ""That's generous of him. I've made it clear that I will do everything in my power to find the missing Memoirs by next Wednesday."" Battle interjected, ""That will be quite a challenge."" Anthony hesitated, ""Do you really think so? I suspect King Victor and his associates are already in possession of the letters."" Battle confirmed, ""They took them from Giuseppe on that day in Pont Street. It was a well-executed operation. They have the letters, they have decoded them, and they know exactly where to search."" As they were about to leave the room, the tension was palpable.",1
"""My orders are clear: deliver the manuscript not to your charming Society, but to a specific publishing house."" The other man laughed mockingly. ""Do you honestly believe you'll make it to that office in one piece? Enough of this nonsense. Hand over the documents, or I'll pull the trigger."" With a swift movement, he pulled out a revolver, waving it menacingly. However, he underestimated Anthony Cade. Unaccustomed to individuals who could act swiftly or even quicker than they could think he was caught off guard. Anthony didn't hesitate for a moment, swiftly moving forward and disarming his opponent before he could react.",1
"""Thank goodness we're both willing to embrace a legacy without pride! The atmosphere must have been quite relaxing."" ""One would assume so, don't you think?"" Anthony furrowed his brow and kept walking back and forth. ""Have you perused the document in any way?"" he inquired abruptly. ""Perused what?"" ""The manuscript."" ""Heavens, no. Why on earth would I want to read something like that?"" Anthony grinned. ""I was just curious, that's all. You're aware that Memoirs have caused quite a bit of trouble. Indiscreet revelations, and all that jazz.""",1
"""Believe, but do not know, huh? That the truth?” “The Prince kept them to himself. He planned to read them and then burn them in the fire.” “I understand,” replied Anthony. “Nevertheless, they are not the type of literature you could rush through in thirty minutes.” “They have not found them among my late master's belongings. It is evident that they have been destroyed.” “Hmm,” pondered Anthony. “I question that.” After a moment of silence, he continued. “I have inquired because, as you may be aware, I have also been connected to the crime.""",1
"""But he was exposed by a lucky accident, forcing him to hastily flee the country. This time, his path led him to England, which is why I find myself here now. It's only a matter of time before he arrives at Chimneys. Unless, of course, he's already here!"" ""You believe that?"" ""I believe he was present the night Prince Michael was killed, and once again last night."" ""So, it was another failed attempt?"" Battle inquired. ""Yes, another failed attempt."" ""What's been troubling me,"" Battle continued, ""is the mystery surrounding M. Lemoine's disappearance.""",1
"He started to feel a glimmer of excitement about the upcoming party. ""You were right, Lomax. The most captivating woman in all of London."" ""She's also quite knowledgeable about Herzoslovakian politics. Remember, her husband served at the Embassy there. And undeniably charming,"" Lomax added. ""Absolutely enchanting,"" Lord Caterham whispered. ""It's settled then."" With that, Lomax released his grip on Lord Caterham's lapel, who wasted no time in taking his leave. ""Goodbye, Lomax. Please handle all the details,"" he said before disappearing into a waiting taxi.",1
"""Would you care to listen to the entire tale?” “If you don't mind, Mr. Cade.” Anthony brought over a pair of chairs, both men sat, and Anthony detailed the occurrences of the previous Thursday evening. Battle remained impassive. A distant gleam appeared in his eyes when Anthony concluded. “You see, sir,” he remarked, “You'll find yourself in trouble sooner or later.” “So, for the second instance, I'm not to be arrested?” “We prefer to allow a man plenty of leeway,” remarked Superintendent Battle. “Nicely phrased,” commented Anthony. “Without overly emphasizing the conclusion of the saying.”",1
"Standing with his back facing the room, he stared directly at the mirror and noticed something strange. The waiter's eyes were fixed on the manuscript. Glancing sideways at Anthony's unmoving figure, he quietly circled the table. His hands trembled, and he nervously licked his lips. Anthony scrutinized him. The waiter was tall, agile like most waiters, with a smooth-shaven, expressive face. An Italian, Anthony surmised, not a Frenchman. Without warning, Anthony abruptly turned around. The waiter flinched, but quickly feigned adjusting the salt cellar. ""What do they call you?"" Anthony demanded.",1
"Lomax was clearly agitated, his voice rising to a high pitch. Lord Caterham, on the other hand, seemed to be enjoying the discussion. ""Why was it hushed up?"" Lomax questioned, struggling to keep his composure. Lord Caterham acknowledged the oddity of the situation, but agreed that there was something suspicious about the manuscript being sent to London in such a roundabout manner. The facts were confirmed by their agents in Paris, who had secretly obtained the Memoirs weeks before the author's death. Lord Caterham's relish for the mystery only grew as they delved deeper into the case.",1
"""I want to know everything about Prince Nicholas, especially his current whereabouts,"" said Battle.  ""Very little is known about him,"" Lomax replied. ""As a young man, he held peculiar beliefs, associated with Socialists and Republicans, and behaved in a manner unbecoming of his status. He was expelled from Oxford, I believe, for a reckless adventure. There were whispers of his demise two years later in the Congo, but they were unfounded. He resurfaced a few months ago when rumors of the Royalist uprising began to circulate."" ""Is that so?"" Battle inquired. ""Where was he seen?"" ""In the United States.""",1
"Virginia, at a tender age of eighteen, found herself constantly confronted by Tim's dramatic declarations of despair if she refused to marry him. Despite her marriage to Tim, Virginia maintained a sense of independence and freedom that she cherished deeply. It was a side of her that few could sway her from. Virginia's nature was complex, a blend of angelic kindness and devilish defiance.",1
"""Finished. And just to irritate you, I would have even paid a hundred! Let me make it clear, James McGrath, you won't be peacefully counting money on your deathbed."" ""Is it a deal then?"" ""It's a deal. I'm in. Down with Castle's Select Tours."" They clinked glasses. ""That settles it,"" Anthony declared, emptying his glass and setting it down. ""Which ship did you choose?"" ""Granarth Castle."" ""I assume you've booked passage under your own name, so I'll have to go as James McGrath. Passports are a thing of the past for us, right?"" ""Doesn't matter. We may be different, but we'd probably share the same label on those cursed things.""",1
"“Isaacstein, do you have any objections if those Oil concessions are given to a different company?” “What are you proposing?” inquired the other, staring directly at him. “A legitimate heir to the throne, with strong pro-British leanings.” “Where is this person?” “That’s confidential.” Isaacstein responded with a slight smile, his gaze turning sharp and intense. “Is this person authentic? I won’t tolerate any deceit.” “Completely authentic.” “Are you sure?” “Absolutely.” “I’ll trust you on this.” “You don’t seem very skeptical,” Anthony remarked, studying him with interest. Herman Isaacstein smiled.",1
"""In what manner, sir?"" questioned the superintendent. ""It will not be too challenging to monitor me,"" Anthony explained gently. He could tell by the brief flutter of the superintendent's eyelids that his remark had hit the mark. Apart from that reflexive twitch of the eyelids, Superintendent Battle's composure remained unchanged. Whether he was taken aback by Virginia's identification of Anthony, he did not reveal. As they exited through the garden door, he and Lord Caterham observed the pair. Mr. Fish observed them as well. ""Pleasant young man, that one,"" remarked Lord Caterham. ""Quite nice for Mrs. Revel to reconnect with an old acquaintance,"" the American murmured.",1
"""You know,"" Anthony began, ""that small contraption belonging to Count Stylptitch actually symbolized a Rose. It hit me on Monday afternoon, leading me straight to the Rose Garden. Interestingly, Mr. Fish had also reached the same conclusion. By positioning yourself with the sundial at your back, moving seven steps forward, followed by eight to the left and three to the right, you'll stumble upon a cluster of bright red rose bushes known as Richmond. Despite the thorough search of the house for the secret spot, no one had considered digging in the garden.""",1
"She unlocked the door with her key, entering the hallway only to find herself face to face with the stoic figure of Chilvers. ""Excuse me, ma'am, but someone has arrived to see you,"" he informed her. Virginia brushed off the subtle language Chilvers used to deliver the message. ""Is it Mr. Lomax? Is he in the drawing-room?"" ""No, ma'am, not Mr. Lomax,"" Chilvers replied, his tone tinged with disappointment. ""The visitor insisted on the urgency of his business, mentioning it was related to the late Captain. I took the liberty of directing him to the study, believing you may want to speak with him.""",1
"Horrid little wretch! He suggested, I remember, that I should marry him morganatically.” “Did he really? And what did he suggest you should do about your existing husband?” “Oh, he had a sort of David and Uriah scheme all made out.” “And how did you respond to this amiable offer?” “Well,” said Virginia, “unfortunately one had to be diplomatic. So poor little Michael didn’t get it as straight from the shoulder as he might have done. But he retired hurt all the same. Why all this interest about Michael?” “Something I’m getting at in my own blundering fashion. I take it that you didn’t meet the murdered man?” “No.",0
"I shouldn’t wonder if I got a hint or two at Chimneys this week-end.” “At Chimneys? You are going to Chimneys?” George could not conceal his perturbation. He had hoped to reach Lord Caterham in time for the invitation to remain unissued. “Bundle rang up and asked me this morning.” George made a last effort. “Rather a dull party, I believe,” he said. “Hardly in your line, Virginia.” “My poor George, why didn’t you tell me the truth and trust me? It’s still not too late.” George took her hand and dropped it again limply.",0
"I send cable after cable, but I can get no word as to his past life. Ten years ago he was in Canada, yes, but since then—silence. My suspicions grow stronger. Then I picked up one day a scrap of paper where he has lately passed along. It bears an address—the address of a house in Dover. Later, as though by chance, I drop that same piece of paper. Out of the tail of my eye, I see this Boris, this Herzoslovakian, pick it up and take it to his master. All along I have been sure that this Boris is an emissary of the Comrades of the Red Hand. We know that the Comrades are working in with King Victor over this affair.",0
"""Are you sorry you ever met me?” she said suddenly. “Lord no. It’s the red signal again. When I first saw you—that day in Pont Street, I knew I was up against something that was going to hurt like fun. Your face did that to me—just your face. There’s magic in you from head to foot—some women are like that, but I’ve never known a woman who had so much of it as you have. You’ll marry some one respectable and prosperous, I suppose, and I shall return to my disreputable life, but I’ll kiss you once before I go—I swear I will.” “You can’t do it now,” said Virginia softly. “Superintendent Battle is watching us out of the library window.” Anthony looked at her.",0
"Now, gentlemen, what is there in this house that is arranged in rows? Books, isn’t that so? Add to that, that in the catalogue of Lord Caterham’s library there is a book called _The Life of the Earl of Richmond_, and I think you will get a very fair idea of the hiding-place. Starting at the volume in question, and using the numbers to denote shelves and books, I think you will find that the—er—object of our search is concealed in a dummy book, or in a cavity behind a particular book.” Anthony looked round modestly, obviously waiting for applause. “Upon my word, that’s very ingenious,” said Lord Caterham.",0
"And though the murder was the work of the Comrades of the Red Hand, punishing supposed treachery on the part of the victim, the staging of it, and the absence of the Comrades’ sign manual, pointed to some abler intelligence directing operations. From the first, I suspected some connection with Herzoslovakia. Mrs. Revel was the only member of the house party who had been to the country. I suspected at first that some one was impersonating Prince Michael, but that proved to be a totally erroneous idea.",0
"I shall be on the platform. As you pass me, drop the Cloak Room ticket. I will pick it up and pretend to return it to you, but in reality I shall keep it. Go on to Chimneys, and leave the rest to me.” “It’s awfully good of you,” said Virginia. “It’s really dreadful of me saddling a perfect stranger with a dead body like this.” “I like it,” returned Anthony nonchalantly. “If one of my friends, Jimmy McGrath, were here, he’d tell you that anything of this kind suits me down to the ground.” Virginia was staring at him. “What name did you say? Jimmy McGrath?” Anthony returned her glance keenly. “Yes. Why? Have you heard of him?” “Yes—and quite lately.",0
"“_Who is he?_ Can anyone guess?” “Putting two and two together,” said Herman Isaacstein, “what with your mysterious hints this morning, and your attitude this afternoon, I should say there was no doubt about it. Somehow or other you’ve managed to get hold of Prince Nicholas of Herzoslovakia.” “You think the same, Baron?” “I do. Unless yet another impostor you have put forward. But that I will not believe. With me, your dealings most honourable have been.” “Thank you, Baron. I shan’t forget those words.",0
"So apprehensive was Lord Caterham of being consulted by George that he spent the whole morning making a tour of his estate. Only the pangs of hunger drew him homeward. He also reflected that by now the worst would surely be over. He sneaked into the house quietly by a small side door. From there he slipped neatly into his sanctum. He flattered himself that his entrance had not been observed, but there he was mistaken. The watchful Tredwell let nothing escape him. He presented himself at the door. “You’ll excuse me, my lord——” “What is it, Tredwell?” “Mr. Lomax, my lord, is anxious to see you in the library as soon as you return.",0
"“Why?” “You can refrain from asking questions.” “You mean that I haven’t asked you what your trade was?” “Just that.” Again they walked on in silence. They were nearing the house now, passing close by the scented sweetness of the rose garden. “You understand well enough, I dare say,” said Anthony, breaking the silence. “You know when a man’s in love with you. I don’t suppose you care a hang for me—or for anyone else—but, by God, I’d like to make you care.” “Do you think you could?” asked Virginia, in a low voice. “Probably not, but I’d have a damned good try.",0
"A woman could handle the whole thing delicately and with tact—put the position before him, as it were, without getting his back up. Not that I approve of women in politics—St. Stephen’s is ruined, absolutely ruined, nowadays. But woman in her own sphere can do wonders. Look at Henry’s wife and what she did for him. Marcia was magnificent, unique, a perfect political hostess.” “You don’t want me to ask Marcia down for this party, do you?” asked Lord Caterham faintly, turning a little pale at the mention of his redoubtable sister-in-law. “No, no, you misunderstand me.",0
"Anthony imitated his movements as nearly as possible. “Baron,” he said. Then, drawing forward a chair. “Pray sit down. I have not, I think, had the pleasure of meeting you before?” “That is so,” agreed the Baron, seating himself. “It is my misfortune,” he added politely. “And mine also,” responded Anthony, on the same note. “Let us now to business come,” said the Baron. “I represent in London the Loyalist party of Herzoslovakia.” “And represent it admirably, I am sure,” murmured Anthony. The Baron bowed in acknowledgment of the compliment. “You are too kind,” he said stiffly. “Mr. McGrath, I will not from you conceal anything.",0
"""No,” agreed Bundle. “It would have been much more hopeful if she’d thrown a boot at you or tried to bite you.” “You modern young people seem to have such unpleasant ideas about love-making,” said Lord Caterham plaintively. “It comes from reading _The Sheik_,” said Bundle. “Desert love. Throw her about, etc.” “What is _The Sheik_?” asked Lord Caterham simply. “Is it a poem?” Bundle looked at him with commiserating pity. Then she rose and kissed the top of his head. “Dear old Daddy,” she remarked, and sprang lightly out of the window. Lord Caterham went back to the Sale Rooms.",0
"Battle went round to the front of the house, and a few minutes later Anthony and Virginia heard the sound of a car driving away. Battle rejoined them, carrying in his hand the half-sheet of paper which the Professor had given him. “He’s always like that,” said Battle, referring to the departed Professor. “In the very deuce of a hurry. Clever man, though. Well, here’s the kernel of Her Majesty’s letter. Care to have a look at it?” Virginia stretched out a hand, and Anthony read it over her shoulder. It had been, he remembered, a long epistle, breathing mingled passion and despair.",0
"It’s odd the way Fish disappeared. Didn’t he say anything?” “Not a word. Last time I saw him he was pacing up and down the Rose Garden yesterday afternoon, smoking one of those unpleasant cigars of his. After that he seems to have just melted into the landscape.” “Somebody must have kidnapped him,” said Bundle hopefully. “In another day or two, I expect we shall have Scotland Yard dragging the lake to find his dead body,” said her father gloomily. “It serves me right. At my time of life, I ought to have gone quietly abroad and taken care of my health, and not allowed myself to be drawn into George Lomax’s wild-cat schemes.",0
"""By the way, Eversleigh, you might ring up a number for me now. Look it up in the book. Mrs. Revel, 487, Pont Street.” “Yes, sir.” Bill seized the telephone-book, ran an unseeing eye down a column of M’s, shut the book with a bang and moved to the instrument on the desk. With his hand upon it, he paused, as though in sudden recollection. “Oh, I say, sir, I’ve just remembered. Her line’s out of order. Mrs. Revel’s, I mean. I was trying to ring her up just now.” George Lomax frowned. “Annoying,” he said, “distinctly annoying.” He tapped the table undecidedly.",0
"“But it’s never much good looking when you don’t know where to look. Only suppose now, that this King Victor came here to look for the thing, was surprised by Prince Michael, and shot him.” “It’s possible,” said George. “A most likely solution of the crime.” “I wouldn’t go as far as that. It’s possible, but not much more.” “Why is that?” “Because King Victor has never been known to take a life,” said Battle seriously. “Oh, but a man like that—a dangerous criminal——” But Battle shook his head in a dissatisfied manner. “Criminals always act true to type, Mr. Lomax. It’s surprising. All the same——” “Yes?” “I’d rather like to question the Prince’s servant.",0
"It was something of a feat, even for Anthony. To one of the topmost branches, he affixed a small brown-paper parcel, concealing it in a little niche close to the bole. “A very clever way of disposing of the pistol,” said Anthony to himself with some approval. “Everybody hunts about on the ground, and drags ponds. But there are very few people in England who could climb that tree.” Next, back to London and Paddington Station. Here he left the trunk—at the other cloak room this time, the one on the Arrival side. He thought longingly of such things as good rumpsteaks, juicy chops, and large masses of fried potatoes.",0
"""Superintendent Battle, you understand perfectly. I dare say Mr. Lomax has hedged you about with recommendations of secrecy—George would, but surely it’s better to tell us than have us stumbling on the secret all by ourselves, and perhaps doing untold harm. M. Lemoine, don’t you agree with me?” “Madame, I agree with you entirely.” “You can’t go on keeping things dark for ever,” said Battle. “I’ve told Mr. Lomax so. Mr. Eversleigh is Mr. Lomax’s secretary, there’s no objection to his knowing what there is to know. As for Mr. Cade, he’s been brought into the thing willy-nilly, and I consider he’s a right to know where he stands.",0
"Fish handed him a match-box. Anthony helped himself, and handed back the box with a word of thanks. “Roses,” said Anthony, “are all very well. But I don’t feel particularly horticultural this afternoon.” With a disarming smile, he nodded cheerfully. A thundering noise sounded from just outside the house. “Pretty powerful engine she’s got in that car of hers,” remarked Anthony. “There, off she goes.” They had a view of the car speeding down the long drive. Anthony yawned again, and strolled towards the house. He passed in through the door. Once inside, he seemed as though changed to quicksilver.",0
"“I don’t trust that French fellow, Lemoine. The French police are up to all sorts of dodges. Put India-rubber bands round your arm, and then reconstruct the crime and make you jump, and it’s registered on a thermometer. I know that when they call out ‘Who killed Prince Michael?’ I shall register a hundred and twenty-two, or something perfectly frightful, and they’ll haul me off to gaol at once.” The door opened and Tredwell announced: “Mr. George Lomax. Mr. Eversleigh.” “Enter Codders, followed by faithful dog,” murmured Bundle.",0
"But still she did not do so. She stood quite still, paralysed with horror and with a host of conflicting ideas rushing through her brain. The bogus telegram. Had it something to do with this? Supposing Élise had not stayed behind? She would have let herself in—that is, presuming she had had her latchkey with her as usual, to find herself alone in the house with a murdered man—a man whom she had permitted to blackmail her on a former occasion. Of course she had an explanation of that; but thinking of that explanation she was not quite easy in her mind. She remembered how frankly incredible George had found it.",0
"” Lord Caterham drifted sadly away, and Virginia passed out through a side door into the garden. She stood there for a moment, breathing in the crisp October air which was infinitely refreshing to one in her slightly jaded state. She started a little to find Superintendent Battle at her elbow. The man seemed to have an extraordinary knack of appearing out of space without the least warning. “Good morning, Mrs. Revel. Not too tired, I hope?” Virginia shook her head. “It was a most exciting night,” she said. “Well worth the loss of a little sleep.",0
"“She was coming down to search for the jewel that night, you say,” he said. “Might she not have been going to meet her accomplice, King Victor, who was coming from outside? Eh? What do you say to that?” Anthony sighed. “Still at it, my dear Lemoine? How persistent you are! You won’t take my hint that I’ve got a trump card up my sleeve?” But George, whose mind worked slowly, now broke in. “I am still completely at sea. Who was this lady, Baron? You recognize her, it seems?” But the Baron drew himself up and stood very straight and stiff. “You are in error, Mr. Lomax.",0
"We’ve all got hips—although we poor women are trying awfully hard to pretend we haven’t. This hip band is made of red rubber and comes just to above the knee, and it’s simply impossible to walk in it.” “How awful!” said Bill. “Why do you do it?” “Oh, because it gives one such a noble feeling to suffer for one’s silhouette. But don’t let’s talk about my hip band. Give me George’s message.” “He wants to know whether you’ll be in at four o’clock this afternoon.” “I shan’t. I shall be at Ranelagh. Why this sort of formal call? Is he going to propose to me, do you think?” “I shouldn’t wonder.” “Because, if so, you can tell him that I much prefer men who propose on impulse.",0
"His way of retreat was doubtless fully assured. Anthony would merely get himself into trouble. He walked over to the bed, thrusting his hand beneath the pillow and drawing out the Memoirs. Lucky that they had been there and not in the suit-case. He crossed over to the suit-case and looked inside, meaning to take out the letters. Then he swore softly under his breath. _The letters were gone._ It was exactly five minutes to four when Virginia Revel, rendered punctual by a healthy curiosity, returned to the house in Pont Street.",0
"Besides, my doing so puzzled the false Lemoine enormously. You see, as soon as I had given the tip about the ‘rows’ and where the jewel really was, he was keen to pass on the news to his accomplice, and at the same time to keep us all in that room. The note was really to Mademoiselle Brun. He told Tredwell to deliver it at once, and Tredwell did so by taking it upstairs to the schoolroom. Lemoine accused me of being King Victor, by that means creating a diversion and preventing anyone from leaving the room. By the time all that had been cleared up and we adjourned to the library to look for the stone, he flattered himself that the stone would be no longer there to find!” George cleared his throat.",0
"“And with him,” continued the American, “is a lady whose name I did not catch last night. But she is bright—she is very bright.” With Lord Caterham was Virginia Revel. Anthony had been anticipating this meeting all along. He had no idea how to act. He must leave it to Virginia. Although he had full confidence in her presence of mind, he had not the slightest idea what line she would take. He was not long left in doubt. “Why, it’s Mr. Cade,” said Virginia. She held out both hands to him. “So you found you could come down after all?” “My dear Mrs. Revel, I had no idea Mr.",0
"""Cheer up, Bill,” said Virginia, “better luck next time.” “Well,” said Lord Caterham, “what do you think we’d better do now? Go back to bed? I can’t get hold of Badgworthy at this time of night. Tredwell, you know the sort of thing that’s necessary. Just see to it, will you?” “Very good, my lord.” With a sigh of relief, Lord Caterham prepared to retreat. “That beggar, Isaacstein, sleeps soundly,” he remarked, with a touch of envy. “You’d have thought all this row would have brought him down.” He looked across at Mr. Fish. “You found time to dress, I see,” he added.",0
"Then he said slowly: “Are you in earnest about that, old son?” “About what?” “Chucking this job of yours if you could get another?” “Why? You don’t mean to say that you’ve got a job going begging? Why don’t you grab it yourself?” “I have grabbed it—but I don’t much fancy it, that’s why I’m trying to pass it on to you.” Anthony became suspicious. “What’s wrong with it? They haven’t engaged you to teach in a Sunday school, have they?” “Do you think anyone would choose me to teach in a Sunday school?” “Not if they knew you well, certainly.” “It’s a perfectly good job—nothing wrong with it whatsoever.” “Not in South America by any lucky chance? I’ve rather got my eye on South America.",0
"I won’t go through it again, Bundle, do you hear? Not for fifty George Lomaxes! If Chimneys is so valuable to the nation, let the nation buy it. Otherwise I shall sell it to a syndicate and they can turn it into an hotel.” “Where is Codders now?” Bundle is rising to the situation. “At the present minute,” replied Lord Caterham, looking at his watch, “he is good for at least fifteen minutes about the Empire.” Another picture. Mr. Bill Eversleigh, not invited to be present at the graveside ceremony, at the telephone. “No, really, I mean it.... I say, don’t be huffy.... Well, you will have supper to-night anyway?.",0
"“Was it a threat? Not that I’m in the least afraid of old Lollipop. Rather a good name for him, that, by the way. I shall call him Baron Lollipop.” He took a turn or two up and down the room, undecided on his next course of action. The date stipulated upon for delivering the manuscript was a little over a week ahead. To-day was the 5th of October. Anthony had no intention of handing it over before the last moment. Truth to tell, he was by now feverishly anxious to read these Memoirs.",0
"A great man like George could not possibly remember all these annoying details. “I think, Mr. Cade,” he hinted, “that you were about to give us some—er—explanation of what you were doing in the grounds last night at 11.45?” His tone said plainly: “And whatever it may be, we are not likely to believe it.” “Yes, Mr. Cade, what _were_ you doing?” said Lord Caterham, with lively interest. “Well,” said Anthony regretfully. “I’m afraid it’s rather a long story.” He drew out his cigarette case. “May I?” Lord Caterham nodded, and Anthony lit a cigarette, and braced himself for the ordeal. He was aware, none better, of the peril in which he stood.",0
"“But I don’t happen to want a valet.” “You are my master now. I will serve you faithfully.” “Yes—but—look here—I don’t need a valet. I can’t afford one.” Boris Anchoukoff looked at him with a touch of scorn. “I do not ask for money. I served my master. So will I serve you—to the death!” Stepping quickly forward, he dropped on one knee, caught Anthony’s hand and placed it on his forehead. Then he rose swiftly and left the room as suddenly as he had come. Anthony stared after him, his face a picture of astonishment. “That’s damned odd,” he said to himself. “A faithful sort of dog. Curious the instincts these fellows have.” He rose and paced up and down.",0
"Ably seconded by his wife, a daughter of the Duke of Perth, history had been made and unmade at informal week-end parties at Chimneys, and there was hardly anyone of note in England—or indeed in Europe—who had not, at one time or another, stayed there. That was all very well. The ninth Marquis of Caterham had the utmost respect and esteem for the memory of his brother. Henry had done that kind of thing magnificently.",0
"But there is something else. Murder! Yes, murder. The murder of Prince Michael. He interfered with you that night as you were looking for the jewel.” “Lemoine, have you ever known King Victor to do murder?” Anthony’s voice rang out sharply. “You know as well—better than I do, that he has never shed blood.” “Who else but you could have murdered him?” cried Lemoine. “Tell me that!” The last word died on his lips, as a shrill whistle sounded from the terrace outside. Anthony sprang up, all his assumed nonchalance laid aside. “You ask me who murdered Prince Michael?” he cried. “I won’t tell you—I’ll _show_ you.",0
"We are to ‘use the utmost discretion.’” Her father made a sound of annoyance. “That’s just the sort of idiotic thing George Lomax would say. However, once he comes, I shall wash my hands of the whole affair.” He appeared to cheer up a little at the prospect. “And the name of the murdered man was Count Stanislaus?” queried the doctor. A lightning glance passed between father and daughter, and then the former said with some dignity: “Certainly. I said so just now.” “I asked because you didn’t seem quite sure about it before,” explained Cartwright.",0
"I thought you might have seen about it. Man found by the roadside shot. A foreigner. It was in the papers again to-day, of course.” “I did see something about it,” said Anthony carelessly. “Not suicide, apparently.” “No. There was no weapon. As yet the man hasn’t been identified.” “You seem very interested,” said Anthony, smiling. “No connection with Prince Michael’s death, is there?” His hand was quite steady. So were his eyes. Was it his fancy that Superintendent Battle was looking at him with peculiar intentness? “Seems to be quite an epidemic of that sort of thing,” said Battle.",0
"Receiving a reply in the affirmative, he led them up to the window and invited them to peep inside. Seated at a table, the letters spread out in front of him and writing busily on a big sheet of paper was a small red-haired man of middle age. He grunted irritably to himself as he wrote, and every now and then rubbed his nose violently until its hue almost rivalled that of his hair. Presently he looked up. “That you, Battle? What you want me down here to unravel this tomfoolery for? A child in arms could do it. A baby of two could do it on its head.",0
"“Not a mention of it’s ever been made public to this day. We did all that could be done on the quiet—and that was a good deal more than you’d ever imagine, by the way. We’ve got methods of our own that would surprise. That jewel didn’t leave England with the Queen of Herzoslovakia—I can tell you that much. No, Her Majesty hid it somewhere—but where we’ve never been able to discover. But I shouldn’t wonder”—Superintendent Battle let his eyes wander gently round—“if it wasn’t somewhere in this room.” Anthony leapt to his feet. “What? After all these years?” he cried incredulously. “Impossible.",0
"The taxi groaned heavily and jumped forward with a hideous crashing of gears, and Anthony opened the letter. It was rather a curious document. He had to read it four times before he could be sure of what it was all about. Put in plain English (the letter was not in plain English, but in the peculiar involved style common to missives issued by Government officials) it presumed that Mr. McGrath was arriving in England from South Africa to-day—Thursday, it referred obliquely to the Memoirs of Count Stylptitch, and begged Mr.",0
"""Watson to your Sherlock, in fact?” “Detective stories are mostly bunkum,” said Battle unemotionally. “But they amuse people,” he added, as an afterthought. “And they’re useful sometimes.” “In what way?” asked Anthony curiously. “They encourage the universal idea that the police are stupid. When we get an amateur crime, such as a murder, that’s very useful indeed.” Anthony looked at him for some minutes in silence. Battle sat quite still, blinking now and then, with no expression whatsoever on his square placid face. Presently he rose. “Not much good going to bed now,” he observed. “As soon as he’s up, I want to have a few words with his lordship.",0
"“You don’t seem very happy about it, sir?” “Oh, I don’t know. I dare say it will be rather fun. But it’s tying oneself down to regular work. I’ve always avoided that before.” “But you consider it your duty, I suppose, sir?” “Good Lord, no! What an idea. It’s a woman—it’s always a woman, Battle. I’d do more than be a King for her sake.” “Quite so, sir.” “I’ve arranged it so that the Baron and Isaacstein can’t kick. The one wants a King and the other wants oil. They’ll both get what they want, and I’ve got—Oh, Lord, Battle, have you ever been in love?” “I am much attached to Mrs. Battle, sir.",0
"Her colour was coming and going unevenly. “So that is the truth of the letters! I have wondered and wondered.” “What a blackguardly trick,” cried Bill indignantly. “The letters were addressed to Captain O’Neill at his rooms in Paris, and their principal purpose may have light shed upon it by a curious fact which came to light later.",0
"” Anthony reflected for a minute or two. He had intended to keep the Memoirs until the last day of grace, because he was anxious to see for himself what all the fuss was about. Nevertheless, he realized the force of the publisher’s arguments. “All right,” he said, with a little sigh. “Have it your own way. Send your man along. And if you don’t mind sending that cheque as well I’d rather have it now, as I may be going out of England before next Wednesday.” “Certainly, Mr. McGrath. Our representative will call upon you first thing to-morrow morning. It will be wiser not to send anyone direct from the office.",0
"""You believe, but you don’t know, eh? Is that it?” “His Highness in his own keeping retained them. His purpose it was to read them and then by the fire to destroy them.” “I see,” said Anthony. “All the same, they are not the kind of light literature you’d skim through in half an hour.” “Among the effects of my martyred master they have not discovered been. It is clear, therefore, that burnt they are.” “H’m!” said Anthony. “I wonder?” He was silent for a minute or two and then went on. “I have asked you these questions, Baron, because, as you may have heard, I myself have been implicated in the crime.",0
"“I do love you so, Virginia,” he whispered. “I do love you so. Do you love me?” He looked down at her—sure of the answer. Her head rested against his shoulder, and very low, in a sweet shaken voice, she answered: “Not a bit!” “You little devil,” cried Anthony, kissing her again. “Now I know for certain that I shall love you until I die....” Scene—Chimneys, 11 A.M. Thursday morning. Johnson, the police constable, with his coat off, digging. Something in the nature of a funeral feeling seems to be in the air.",0
"""America!” Battle turned to Isaacstein with one laconic word: “Oil?” The financier nodded. “He represented that if the Herzoslovakians chose a King, they would prefer him to Prince Michael as being more in sympathy with modern enlightened ideas, and he drew attention to his early democratic views and his sympathy with Republican ideals. In return for financial support, he was prepared to grant concessions to a certain group of American financiers.” Superintendent Battle so far forgot his habitual impassivity as to give vent to a prolonged whistle. “So that is it,” he muttered.",0
"And, if it’s the former, God help Prince Michael’s murderer when that human bloodhound gets hold of him.” Virginia and Anthony walked side by side down the path which led to the lake. For some minutes after leaving the house they were silent. It was Virginia who broke the silence at last with a little laugh. “Oh, dear,” she said, “isn’t it dreadful? Here I am so bursting with the things I want to tell you, and the things I want to know, that I simply don’t know where to begin. First of all”—she lowered her voice—“_What have you done with the body?_ How awful it sounds, doesn’t it! I never dreamt that I should be so steeped in crime.",0
"Hiram Fish rose bland and reassuring from the window. “No, you don’t, Sonny—not this way. I have been stationed here this whole evening for the particular purpose of preventing your escape. You will observe that I have you covered well and good with this gun of mine. I came over to get you, and I’ve got you—but you sure are some lad!” “You owe us an explanation, I think, Mr. Cade,” said Herman Isaacstein, somewhat later in the evening. “There’s nothing much to explain,” said Anthony modestly. “I went to Dover and Fish followed me under the impression that I was King Victor.",0
"40, by the way.” “All right.” “Now if I can only get rid of Fish too,” continued Lord Caterham, his spirits rising. “I thought you liked talking to him about your mouldy old books.” “So I do, so I do. So I did, rather. But it gets monotonous when one finds that one is always doing all the talking. Fish is very interested, but he never volunteers any statements of his own.” “It’s better than doing all the listening,” said Bundle. “Like one does with George Lomax.” Lord Caterham shuddered at the remembrance. “George is all very well on platforms,” said Bundle. “I’ve clapped him myself, though of course I know all the time that he’s talking balderdash.",0
"“How extraordinary!” “Why extraordinary? Rather high toned for such a low fellow?” “I’m going to Chimneys this evening. At least I was.” Anthony wheeled round on her. “What’s that? Say that again.” “I was going to Chimneys this evening,” repeated Virginia. Anthony stared at her. “I begin to see. At least, I may be wrong—but it’s an idea. Suppose some one wanted badly to prevent your going to Chimneys?” “My cousin George Lomax does,” said Virginia with a smile. “But I can’t seriously suspect George of murder.” Anthony did not smile.",0
"What Lord Caterham objected to was the assumption that he was bound to follow in his brother’s footsteps, and that Chimneys was a National possession rather than a private country house. There was nothing that bored Lord Caterham more than politics—unless it was politicians. Hence his impatience under the continued eloquence of George Lomax. A robust man, George Lomax, inclined to _embonpoint_, with a red face and protuberant eyes, and an immense sense of his own importance. “You see the point, Caterham? We can’t—we simply can’t afford a scandal of any kind just now.",0
"There was a long refectory table and a good many oak chests, and some beautiful old chairs. On the walls were various paintings of dead and gone Caterhams and others. Near the left-hand wall, about half-way between the door and the window, a man was lying on his back, his arms flung wide. Dr. Cartwright went over and knelt down by the body. The inspector strode across to the windows, and examined them in turn. The centre one was closed, but not fastened. On the steps outside were footprints leading up to the window, and a second set going away again. “Clear enough,” said the inspector, with a nod.",0
"“Bill,” she said. “Oh, Bill.” She shook him harder. “Bill,” she said. “Wake up. Oh, do wake up!” Very dazed, Bill woke up. He was in his bedroom at Chimneys. But part of the dream was with him still. Virginia was leaning over him, and was repeating the same words with variations. “Wake up, Bill. Oh, do wake up. Bill.” “Hullo!” said Bill, sitting up in bed. “What’s the matter?” Virginia gave a sigh of relief. “Thank goodness. I thought you’d never wake up. I’ve been shaking you and shaking you. Are you properly awake now?” “I think so,” said Bill doubtfully. “You great lump,” said Virginia. “The trouble I’ve had! My arms are aching.” “These insults are uncalled for,” said Bill, with dignity.",0
"Presidents only take on the job for four years or so. It would quite amuse me to govern a kingdom like Herzoslovakia for four years.” “The average for Kings is even less, I should say,” interpolated Jimmy. “It will probably be a serious temptation to me to embezzle your share of the thousand pounds. You won’t want it, you know, when you get back weighed down with nuggets. I’ll invest it for you in Herzoslovakian oil shares. You know, James, the more I think of it, the more pleased I am with this idea of yours. I should never have thought of Herzoslovakia if you hadn’t mentioned it.",0
"You’re very concerned about this unknown lady, James?” Jimmy ran his finger thoughtfully over the signature. “It’s a pretty name,” he said apologetically. “_Virginia Revel._” “Quite so, my dear fellow, quite so,” said Lord Caterham. He had used the same words three times already, each time in the hope that they would end the interview and permit him to escape. He disliked very much being forced to stand on the steps of the exclusive London club to which he belonged and listen to the interminable eloquence of the Hon. George Lomax.",0
"Lomax.” “And where does he say he found them—on his dressing-table?” Battle repeated, word for word, Anthony Cade’s account of how he had come to regain possession of the letters. “And he brought them at once to you? That was quite proper—quite proper. But who could have placed them in his room?” Battle shook his head. “That’s the sort of thing you ought to know,” complained George. “It sounds to me very fishy—very fishy indeed. What do we know about this man Cade anyway? He appears in a most mysterious manner—under highly suspicious circumstances—and we know nothing whatever about him. I may say that I, personally, don’t care for his manner at all.",0
"Here’s a young man who ought to cut and run, but he doesn’t cut and run. He stays here, and gives us every facility for comparing footmarks.” “What do you think, then?” “I don’t know what to think. And that’s a very disturbing state of mind.” “Do you imagine——” began Colonel Melrose, but broke off as a discreet knock came at the door. George rose and went to it. Tredwell, inwardly suffering from having to knock at doors in this low fashion, stood dignified upon the threshold, and addressed his master.",0
"On the threshold stood a tall man with black hair neatly parted in the middle, china blue eyes with a particularly innocent expression, and a large placid face. “Your pardon, gentlemen,” he said in a slow drawling voice with a pronounced transatlantic accent. “But is it permitted to inspect the scene of the crime? I take it that you are both gentlemen from Scotland Yard?” “I have not that honour,” said Anthony. “But this gentleman is Superintendent Battle of Scotland Yard.” “Is that so?” said the American gentleman, with a great appearance of interest. “Pleased to meet you, sir.",0
"And at that minute the front-door bell rang. Virginia jumped. In a few minutes it rang again. Élise, she knew, was upstairs packing and wouldn’t hear it. Virginia went out in the hall, drew back the chain, and undid all the bolts that Élise had fastened in her zeal. Then, with a long breath, she threw open the door. On the steps was the unemployed young man. Virginia plunged headlong with a relief born of overstrung nerves. “Come in,” she said. “I think that perhaps I’ve got a job for you.",0
"Yesterday I received from France the fingerprints and the Bertillon measurements of King Victor—the so-called Captain O’Neill. I have asked for them to be sent up to me here. In a few minutes we shall _know_ whether you are the man!” Anthony stared steadily at him. Then a little smile crept over his face. “You’re really rather clever, Lemoine. I never thought of that. The documents will arrive, you will induce me to dip my fingers in the ink, or something equally unpleasant, you will measure my ears and look for my distinguishing marks.",0
"Who wants to be a peer nowadays?” “Nobody,” said Bundle. “They’d much rather keep a prosperous public house.” Tredwell reappeared silently with two poached eggs in a little silver dish which he placed on the table in front of Lord Caterham. “What’s that, Tredwell?” said the latter, looking at them with faint distaste. “Poached eggs, my lord.” “I hate poached eggs,” said Lord Caterham peevishly. “They’re so insipid. I don’t like to look at them even. Take them away, will you, Tredwell?” “Very good, my lord.” Tredwell and the poached eggs withdrew as silently as they came. “Thank God no one gets up early in this house,” remarked Lord Caterham devoutly.",0
"“We’re averaging about fifty as it is.” “I’m burning with curiosity to know the reason of this sudden departure,” said Bundle, after executing a fanfare upon the Klaxon which must temporarily have deafened the neighbourhood. “But I suppose I mustn’t ask? You’re not escaping from justice, are you?” “I’m not quite sure,” said Anthony. “I shall know soon.” “That Scotland Yard man isn’t as much of a rabbit as I thought,” said Bundle thoughtfully. “Battle’s a good man,” agreed Anthony. “You ought to have been in diplomacy,” remarked Bundle.",0
"She drew Bill into the small drawing-room which was all pale and mauve and green and yellow, like crocuses surprised in a meadow. “Bill, darling,” said Virginia, “isn’t the Foreign Office missing you? I thought they couldn’t get on without you.” “I’ve brought a message for you from Codders.” Thus irreverently did Bill allude to his chief. “And by the way, Virginia, in case he asks, remember that your telephone was out of order this morning.” “But it hasn’t been.” “I know that. But I said it was.” “Why? Enlighten me as to this Foreign Office touch.” Bill threw her a reproachful glance. “So that I could get here and see you, of course.",0
"“See that that is delivered at once, if you please.” “Very good, sir,” said Tredwell. With his usual dignified tread he withdrew. Anthony, who had been standing, irresolute, sat down again. “What’s the big idea, Lemoine?” he asked gently. There was a sudden sense of strain in the atmosphere. “If the jewel is where you say it is—well, it has been there for over seven years—a quarter of an hour more does not matter.” “Go on,” said Anthony. “That wasn’t all you wanted to say?” “No, it was not. At this juncture, it is—unwise to permit any one person to leave the room.",0
"The most notorious jewel thief in the world. A fantastic, daring fellow, not to be daunted by anything. King Victor was the nickname he was known by in Paris. Paris was the headquarters of his gang. They caught him there and put him away for seven years on a minor charge. They couldn’t prove the more important things against him. He’ll be out soon—or he may be out already.” “Do you think Count Stylptitch had anything to do with putting him away? Was that why the gang went for him? Out of revenge?” “I don’t know,” said Anthony. “It doesn’t seem likely on the face of it.",0
"They were high-spirited young women of twelve and ten, and though their names might be Dulcie and Daisy, as Bundle had affirmed, they appeared to be more generally known as Guggle and Winkle. They executed a kind of war dance, interspersed with shrill whoops till Bundle emerged and quelled them. “Where’s Mademoiselle?” she demanded. “She’s got the _migraine_, the _migraine_, the _migraine_!” chanted Winkle. “Hurrah!” said Guggle, joining in. Lord Caterham had succeeded in shepherding most of his guests into the house. Now he laid a restraining hand on Anthony’s arm. “Come to my study,” he breathed.",0
"“Ah, sir, you observed me, then, in my seclooded retreat? There are moments, sir, when far from the madding crowd is the only motto for a man of quiet tastes.” Bundle had drifted on, and the American and Anthony were left together. The former dropped his voice a little. “I opine,” he said, “that there is considerable mystery about this little dust up?” “Any amount of it,” said Anthony. “That guy with the bald head was perhaps a family connection?” “Something of the kind.” “These Central European nations beat the band,” declared Mr. Fish. “It’s kind of being rumoured around that the deceased gentleman was a Royal Highness.",0
"""Do you think it likely, sir?” “Well, it would be in keeping with their propaganda. But I’ve always found that those who talk most about blood have never actually seen it run. I shouldn’t have said the Comrades had the guts myself. And they’re such picturesque people too. I don’t see one of them disguising himself as a suitable guest for a country house. Still, one never knows.” “Quite right, Mr. Cade. One never knows.” Anthony looked suddenly amused. “I see the big idea now. Open window, trail of footprints, suspicious stranger at village inn. But I can assure you, my dear superintendent, that, whatever I am, I am not the local agent of the Red Hand.",0
"Anthony glanced quickly from left to right. Carlo was not due round again just yet. He grasped the heavy Virginia creeper and climbed nimbly till he reached the sill of a window. The window was shut, but with a tool from his pocket he soon succeeded in forcing up the catch. He paused a minute to listen, then sprang lightly inside the room. There was a bed in the far corner and on that bed a man was lying, his figure barely discernible in the gloom. Anthony went over to the bed, and flashed his pocket torch on the man’s face.",0
"“In the meantime, the Loyalist party supported Prince Michael, and you felt sure you’d come out on top. And then this happens!” “You surely don’t think——” began George. “It was a big deal,” said Battle. “Mr. Isaacstein says so. And I should say that what he calls a big deal _is_ a big deal.” “There are always unscrupulous tools to be got hold of,” said Isaacstein quietly. “For the moment, Wall Street wins. But they’ve not done with me yet. Find out who killed Prince Michael, Superintendent Battle, if you want to do your country a service.",0
"“I was struck by something unusual in the waiter’s manner, but thought nothing more of it at the time. Later, in the night, I was awakened by the sound of some one moving softly about the room. I switched on the light, and found this same Giuseppe in the act of rifling my leather suit-case.” The manager’s indifference had completely disappeared now. “But I have heard nothing of this,” he exclaimed. “Why was I not informed sooner?” “The man and I had a brief struggle—he was armed with a knife by the way. In the end he succeeded in making off by way of the window.” “What did you do then, Mr. McGrath?” “I examined the contents of my suit-case.",0
"He’d had a couple, no doubt about that, but he was sober enough to get my name and address out of me, and he came along and thanked me next day. Did the thing in style too. It was then that I found out it was Count Stylptitch I’d rescued. He’d got a house up by the Bois.” Anthony nodded. “Yes, Stylptitch went to live in Paris after the assassination of King Nicholas. They wanted him to come back and be President later, but he wasn’t taking any. He remained sound to his Monarchical principals, though he was reported to have his finger in all the backstairs pies that went on in the Balkans.",0
"One last fond look before you go? No? Oh, George, dear, don’t be sulky about it!” Virginia ran to the telephone as soon as George had departed with a heavy gait through the front door. She obtained the number she required and asked to speak to Lady Eileen Brent. “Is that you, Bundle? I’m coming to Chimneys all right to-morrow. What? Bore me? No, it won’t. Bundle, wild horses wouldn’t keep me away! So there!” The letters were gone! Having once made up his mind to the fact of their disappearance, there was nothing to do but accept it.",0
"” She paused irresolutely, and then went on. “Mr. Cade, I must talk to you. Can’t you come down to Chimneys?” “You’ll see me before very long, Mrs. Revel—I’ll tell you that. Now, exit Conspirator A by back door slinkingly. Exit Conspirator B in blaze of glory by front door to taxi.” The plan went through without a hitch. Anthony, having picked up a second taxi, was on the platform and duly retrieved the fallen ticket. He then departed in search of a somewhat battered second-hand Morris Cowley which he had acquired earlier in the day in case it should be necessary to his plans.",0
"“Very nice,” he commented. “Nothing much to beat old England, is there?” “Did it seem to you at first it was in this room the shot was fired?” asked the superintendent, not replying to Anthony’s eulogium. “Let me see.” Anthony opened the window and went out on the terrace, looking up at the house. “Yes, that’s the room all right,” he said. “It’s built out, and occupies all the corner. If the shot had been fired anywhere else, it would have sounded from the _left_, but this was from behind me or to the right if anything. That’s why I thought of poachers.",0
"If the newspapers can get hold of anything connected with a big fashionable hotel such as this, they always run it for all it is worth, no matter how insignificant the real subject matter may be.” “Quite so,” agreed Anthony. “Now I told you that nothing of value had been taken, and that was perfectly true in a sense. Nothing of any value to the thief was taken, but he got hold of something which is of considerable value to me.” “Ah?” “Letters, you understand.” An expression of superhuman discretion, only to be achieved by a Frenchman, settled down upon the manager’s face. “I comprehend,” he murmured. “But perfectly. Naturally, it is not a matter for the police.",0
"""One thing strikes me as highly suspicious,” put in George. “Why did the equerry, Captain Andrassy, not come down with the Prince yesterday?” “I’ve inquired into that,” said Battle. “It’s perfectly simple. He stayed in town to make arrangements with a certain lady, on behalf of Prince Michael, for next week-end. The Baron rather frowned on such things, thinking them injudicious at the present stage of affairs, so His Highness had to go about them in a hole and corner manner.",0
"“Did Stylptitch say anything else of the same kind? That he knew which city the Wallace Collection was in, for instance?” Jimmy shook his head. “H’m!” said Anthony. He lit another cigarette, and once more began pacing up and down the room. “You never read the papers, I suppose, you heathen?” he threw out presently. “Not very often,” said McGrath simply. “They’re not about anything that interests me as a rule.” “Thank Heaven I’m more civilized. There have been several mentions of Herzoslovakia lately. Hints at a Royalist restoration.” “Nicholas IV didn’t leave a son,” said Jimmy.",0
"“I flung on a few articles of clothing, yes,” admitted the American. “Very sensible of you,” said Lord Caterham. “Damned chilly things, pyjamas.” He yawned. In a rather depressed mood, the house party retired to bed. The first person that Anthony saw as he alighted from his train on the following afternoon was Superintendent Battle. His face broke into a smile. “I’ve returned according to contract,” he remarked. “Did you come down here to assure yourself of the fact?” Battle shook his head. “I wasn’t worrying about that, Mr. Cade. I happen to be going to London, that’s all.” “You have such a trustful nature, Battle.” “Do you think so, sir?” “No. I think you’re deep—very deep.",0
"""Bill, I adore you. If I had to marry some one—simply had to—I mean if it was in a book and a wicked mandarin said to me ‘Marry some one or die by slow torture,’ I should choose you at once—I should indeed. I should say, ‘Give me little Bill.’” “Well, then——” “Yes, but I haven’t got to marry any one. I love being a wicked widow.” “You could do all the same things still. Go about, and all that. You’d hardly notice me about the house.” “Bill, you don’t understand. I’m the kind of person who marries enthusiastically if they marry at all.” Bill gave a hollow groan.",0
"We’ve been at Cowes and Deauville all the summer after town, and then up to Scotland. Chimneys has been swathed in dust sheets for about five months. Once a week they take the dust sheets off and chars-à-bancs full of tourists come and gape, and listen to Tredwell. ‘On your right is the portrait of the fourth Marchioness of Caterham, painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds,’ etc., and Ed or Bert, the humorist of the party, nudges his girl and says ‘Eh! Gladys, they’ve got two pennyworth of pictures here, right enough.’ And then they go and look at more pictures and yawn and shuffle their feet and wish it was time to go home.",0
"” Virginia stood thinking for a minute. She had been a widow now for some years, and the fact that she rarely spoke of her husband was taken by some to indicate that below her careless demeanour was a still aching wound. By others it was taken to mean the exact opposite, that Virginia had never really cared for Tim Revel, and that she found it insincere to profess a grief she did not feel. “I should have mentioned, ma’am,” continued Chilvers, “that the man appears to be some kind of foreigner.” Virginia’s interest heightened a little.",0
"But it was rumoured round the _Jolly Dog_, or whatever the name of your local pub may be, that you had had a murder up here, and as I thought I might be able to throw some light upon it I came along.” For a moment or two, no one spoke. Superintendent Battle because he was a man of ripe experience who knew how infinitely better it was to let every one else speak if they could be persuaded upon to do so, Colonel Melrose because he was habitually taciturn, George because he was in the habit of having notice given him of the question, Lord Caterham because he had not the least idea of what to say.",0
"There was a faint twinkle in his eye, and Lord Caterham looked at him reproachfully. “I’ll take you to the Council Chamber,” he said more briskly. They followed him, the inspector bringing up the rear, and darting sharp glances all around him as he went, much as though he expected to find a clue in a picture frame, or behind a door. Lord Caterham took a key from his pocket and unlocked a door, flinging it open. They all passed into a big room panelled in oak, with three long windows giving on the terrace.",0
"Her astonishment was so genuine that Anthony could but believe in it. “Sit down,” he said quietly. “There’s more in this than there seemed to be first go off. To begin with, what’s our hypothesis? There are only two possible ones. There is, of course, the real Virginia of the letters. She may have somehow or other tracked him down, shot him, dropped the pistol, stolen the letters, and taken herself off. That’s quite possible, isn’t it?” “I suppose so,” said Virginia unwillingly. “The other hypothesis is a good deal more interesting.",0
"The genius of Professor Wynward had transformed it into an essentially business-like communication. _Operations carried out successfully, but S. double crossed us. Has removed stone from hiding-place. Not in his room. I have searched. Found following memorandum which I think refers to it_: “RICHMOND SEVEN STRAIGHT EIGHT LEFT THREE RIGHT.” “S.?” said Anthony. “Stylptitch, of course. Cunning old dog. He changed the hiding-place.” “Richmond,” said Virginia thoughtfully. “Is the diamond concealed somewhere at Richmond, I wonder?” “It’s a favourite spot for Royalties,” agreed Anthony. Battle shook his head. “I still think it’s a reference to something in this house.",0
"He had no intention of allowing his suit-case to be rifled whilst he was downstairs in the Grill Room. He rang the bell and asked for the Menu, selected a couple of dishes and ordered a bottle of Bordeaux. The waiter took the order and withdrew. Whilst he was waiting for the meal to arrive, he got out the package of manuscript and put it on the table with the letters. There was a knock at the door, and the waiter entered with a small table and the accessories of the meal. Anthony had strolled over to the mantelpiece.",0
"Would other people think the same. Those letters now—of course she hadn’t written them, but would it be so easy to prove that? She put her hands on her forehead, squeezing them tight together. “I must think,” said Virginia. “I simply must think.” Who had let the man in? Surely not Élise. If she had done so, she would have been sure to have mentioned the fact at once. The whole thing seemed more and more mysterious as she thought about it. There was really only one thing to be done—ring up the police. She stretched out her hand to the telephone, and suddenly she thought of George.",0
"She understood what Anthony had meant when he said there were no flies on Superintendent Battle. “Has he ever told you anything about his life?” the detective continued. “Before he was in South Africa, I mean. Canada? Or before that, the Sudan? Or about his boyhood?” Virginia merely shook her head. “And yet I’d bet he’s got something worth telling. You can’t mistake the face of a man who’s led a life of daring and adventure. He could tell you some interesting tales if he cared to.” “If you want to know about his past life, why don’t you cable to that friend of his, Mr. McGrath?” Virginia asked. “Oh, we have.",0
"“They have been acquainted some time, presoomably?” “Seems so,” said Lord Caterham. “But I’ve never heard her mention him before. Oh, by the way, Battle, Mr. Lomax has been asking for you. He’s in the Blue morning-room.” “Very good, Lord Caterham. I’ll go there at once.” Battle found his way to the Blue morning-room without difficulty. He was already familiar with the geography of the house. “Ah, there you are, Battle,” said Lomax. He was striding impatiently up and down the carpet. There was one other person in the room, a big man sitting in a chair by the fireplace.",0
"Lord Caterham, Bundle, and various frightened servants were standing in the doorway of the Council Chamber. “What the devil’s the matter?” asked Bundle. “Is it burglars? What are you and Mr. Fish doing, Virginia? Taking a midnight stroll?” Virginia explained the events of the evening. “How frightfully exciting,” commented Bundle. “You don’t usually get a murder and a burglary crowded into one week-end. What’s the matter with the lights in here? They’re all right everywhere else.” That mystery was soon explained. The bulbs had simply been removed and laid in a row against the wall.",0
"“And I’m glad I’m not going to be left out of it.” “What about refreshments?” said Anthony. “Where does the conference take place? Here?” “If you please, sir,” said Battle, “I’ve a fancy for not leaving this room until morning. You’ll see why when you’ve heard the story.” “Then I’ll go and forage,” said Anthony. Bill went with him and they returned with a tray of glasses, siphons and other necessaries of life. The augmented syndicate established itself comfortably in the corner by the window, being grouped round a long oak table.",0
"“Baron,” he said, and there was a curious note in his voice, “when this evening is over, I think you will be the first to admit that there is more earnest than jest about this business.” Bowing to both the men, he left the room. His next call was in the City where he sent in his card to Mr. Herman Isaacstein. After some delay, Anthony was received by a pale and exquisitely dressed underling with an engaging manner, and a military title. “You wanted to see Mr. Isaacstein, didn’t you?” said the young man. “I’m afraid he’s most awfully busy this morning—board meetings and all that sort of thing, you know.",0
"I must clear myself absolutely, so that no suspicion attaches to me.” “Undoubtedly,” said the Baron. “Your honour demands it.” “Exactly,” said Anthony. “You put these things so well. I haven’t got the knack of it. To continue, I can only clear myself by discovering the real murderer, and to do that I must have all the facts. This question of the Memoirs is very important. It seems to me possible that to gain possession of them might be the motive of the crime. Tell me, Baron, is that a very far-fetched idea?” The Baron hesitated for a moment or two.",0
"“I’m quite happy and busy down here.” “The man fears me,” said Bundle. “Either my driving or my fatal fascination! Which is it?” “The latter,” said Anthony. “Every time.” “Bundle, dear,” said Virginia, “is there any secret passage leading out of the Council Chamber?” “Rather. But it’s only a mouldy one. Supposed to lead from Chimneys to Wyvvern Abbey. So it did in the old, old days, but it’s all blocked up now. You can only get along it for about a hundred yards from this end. The one upstairs in the White Gallery is ever so much more amusing, and the Priest’s Hole isn’t half bad.” “We’re not regarding them from an artistic standpoint,” explained Virginia.",0
"And then I wanted to know too much, and he tried to put me off with lies that wouldn’t have deceived a child of two.” “Well, his plan seems to have succeeded, anyhow,” observed Anthony. “Here am I, the James McGrath he had in mind, and here are you being agreeable to me.” “But, alas, for poor old George, no Memoirs! Now I’ve got a question for you. When I said I hadn’t written those letters, you said you knew I hadn’t—you couldn’t know any such thing?” “Oh, yes, I could,” said Anthony, smiling. “I’ve got a good working knowledge of psychology.” “You mean your belief in the sterling worth of my moral character was such that——” But Anthony was shaking his head vigorously. “Not at all.",0
"Especially before breakfast,” continued Lord Caterham, reverting to his principal grievance. “Who have you asked so far?” “Cade. He was up very early this morning. He’s going to stop on. I don’t mind that. I can’t quite make the fellow out; but I like him—I like him very much.” “So does Virginia,” said Bundle, drawing a pattern on the table with her fork. “Eh?” “And so do I. But that doesn’t seem to matter.” “And I asked Isaacstein,” continued Lord Caterham. “Well?” “But fortunately he’s got to go back to town. Don’t forget to order the car for the 10.",0
"He had meant to do so on the boat coming over, but had been laid low with a touch of fever, and not at all in the mood for deciphering crabbed and illegible handwriting, for none of the manuscript was typed. He was now more than ever determined to see what all the fuss was about. There was the other job too. On an impulse, he picked up the telephone book and looked up the name of Revel. There were six Revels in the book: Edward Henry Revel, surgeon, of Harley Street; James Revel & Co., saddlers; Lennox Revel of Abbotbury Mansions, Hampstead; Miss Mary Revel with an address in Ealing; Hon. Mrs.",0
